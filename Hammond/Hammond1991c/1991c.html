<p>ABSTRACT: Evaluating the stability of variable landforms is important for land 
  management planning on forest lands in the western United States and Alaska. 
  This paper describes a rational means for considering both natural variability 
  and measurement uncertainty in landslide hazard evaluation of both natural slopes, 
  and constructed cut and fill slopes. Monte Carlo simulation is used to simulate 
  the frequency distribution of the factor of safety on a given landform or slope. 
  The probability of failure is taken as the relative frequency with which the 
  factors of safety are less than or equal to one. The simulation program is written 
  for IBM-PC's and compatibles, includes a menu-driven user interface, and allows 
  the use of seven different input probability distributions to describe the natural 
  variability and uncertainty of each input variable.</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION<br><br>
  Many forest lands in the western United States and Alaska are classified as 
  potentially unstable. Unless carefully planned and executed, timber harvesting 
  operations, road construction or other land management activities in these areas 
  can accelerate mass failure and may cause significant impacts on soil productivity 
  and water quality. Accurate assessment of potential landslide hazard early in 
  the planning process is essential. We believe a geotechnical stability model 
  approach for hazard assessment has advantages over subjective or statistical 
  approaches (e.g. Roth 1983) because it is widely applicable (model-based, not 
  data-based), and because it can be used for sensitivity studies and to predict 
  the effects of managerial actions. We also believe that a probabilistic approach 
  is essential when rationally considering the natural variability and uncertainty 
  of each input variable in a stability analysis. This paper describes two microcomputer 
  programs, LISA and SARA, which use Monte Carlo simulation to help quantify the 
  probability of slope failure for both natural and man-made slopes and to assess 
  the effect of management activities such as timber harvest.</p>

<p>2. MONTE CARLO SIMULATION<br><br>
  Monte Carlo simulation is useful for modeling an attribute that cannot be sampled 
  or measured directly, but can be expressed as a mathematical function of properties 
  that can be sampled. Factor of safety fits this situation. Although other probabilistic 
  methods are available for estimating landslide failure probabilities (e.g. Chowdhury 
  and Tang 1987), Monte Carlo simulation is the method used in LISA and SARA because 
  it allows all input variables to be treated stochastically, as is necessary 
  for a realistic stability assessment of large landforms where all variables 
  can have significant spatial variability and measurement uncertainty. <BR>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we 
  want to predict a possible value of the factor of safety, we take a possible 
  value for each input variable and use an appropriate equation to calculate the 
  corresponding factor of safety value. This is known as one Monte Carlo pass 
  or iteration. In Monte Carlo simulation we generate a considerable number of 
  factor of safety values, say 1000, by repeated random, independent samplings 
  of a set of possible input values, and then calculate the corresponding factor 
  of safety value for each pass. The set of possible input values is described 
  by a probability distribution for each input variable. In the LISA and SARA 
  computer models, the user may choose a constant value or a uniform, normal, 
  lognormal, triangular, beta, histogram, or bivariate normal probability distribution. 
  The result is 1000 possible factor of safety values that can be displayed as 
  a histogram; the probability of failure (<i>P<sub>&fnof;</sub></i>&nbsp;) then is obtained by dividing 
  the total number of passes into the number of calculated factor of safety values 
  which are less than or equal to one.

  <em>2.1 The performance functions</em><br>
  <br>
  The LISA and SARA computer models use the infinite slope model as the performance 
  function to analyze the stability of natural slopes, and stability number charts 
  developed by Cousins (1978) and quantified by Pyles and others (1984) to analyze 
  the stability of man-made slopes, such as road cut and fill slopes or embankments. 
  The infinite slope equation used in the computer models is:</p>

  The user may either specify <i>h</i>, or specify the cut and fill slope ratios 
  and road and ditch widths and the program will determine <i>h</i> by superimposing 
  a full bench, through fill, or self-balanced road prism on the natural slope.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both models are well suited to Monte Carlo simulation because the critical failure 
  surfaces are assumed&#8212;the infinite slope model assumes a planar failure 
  surface (typically the bedrock surface) which is parallel to both the ground 
  surface and the phreatic surface, and the Cousins' method assumes a circular 
  arc exiting at the slope toe. Although both models tend to oversimplify in situ 
  conditions, they have been found to be adequate for planning purposes (Prellwitz 
  and others 1983, Sidle and others 1985); however, Cousins' stability number 
  charts do require modification to account for sloping bedrock and phreatic surfaces 
  typically found in mountainous terrain. This modification is accounted for by 
  the empirical factor, <i>k</i>, which relates the factor of safety estimated using 
  Cousins' charts to the critical failure circle (with a factor of safety of 1.00) 
  found using modified Bishop analysis for a variety of typical slope, groundwater 
  height and soil shear strength conditions (Prellwitz 1988).</p>
  <p>

  <em>2.2 Correlation between variables</em><br>
  <br>
  To achieve a realistic simulation using Monte Carlo methods, the relationships 
  between dependent variables must be taken into account. The variables treated 
  as dependent in the LISA and SARA models are <i>C<sub>s</sub></i> and <i>&phi;&prime;</i>, 
  and dry unit weight (<i>&gamma;<sub>d</sub></i>) and <i>&phi;&prime;</i>.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there exists some contradiction in the literature,
  <i>C<sub>s</sub></i> and <i>&phi;&prime;</i> 
  generally are considered to be inversely related with reported correlation coefficients 
  (<i>r</i>&nbsp;) of -0.2 to -0.85 (Cherubini and others 1983). If this correlation is not 
  considered in the simulation, soil shear strength can be significantly overestimated 
  and underestimated, resulting in an increase in variance of simulated shear 
  strength. The bivariate normal probability density function (PDF) can be used 
  in LISA and SARA to model <i>C<sub>s</sub>&#8212;&phi;&prime;</i> dependence.<BR> <!-- sic dependance -->

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second relationship 
  considered by LISA and SARA is the positive correlation that exists between 
  <i>&gamma;<sub>d</sub></i> and <i>&phi;&prime;</i>. The models handle this correlation very 
  simplistically by using the same random number to sample from the univariate 
  distributions for <i>&gamma;<sub>d</sub></i> and <i>&phi;&prime;</i>; therefore, when a high 
  value is sampled for <i>&gamma;<sub>d</sub></i>, a high value is sampled for <i>&phi;&prime;</i> 
  to model the desired proportional relationship. This method produces <i>r</i> values 
  between <i>&gamma;<sub>d</sub></i> and <i>&phi;&prime;</i> of 0.95 to 1.0 (with 1.0 occurring 
  when the same distribution type is used for both variables). This degree of 
  correlation is greater than typically found in nature; however, because the 
  infinite slope equation is generally insensitive to <i>&gamma;<sub>d</sub></i>, the 
  <i>P<sub>&fnof;</sub></i>&nbsp; values are affected only slightly.<BR>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dependence between other variables, such as an inverse 
  relationship between soil depth and ground slope, is sometimes observed. At 
  this time, LISA and SARA do not have the capability of allowing the user to 
  enter a functional relationship between selected variables to model such correlations 
  in a rigorous manner. Instead, the user must subdivide geomorphic landforms 
  into smaller units with narrow ranges of input values, so that within those 
  ranges, one could expect all other variables to be independent.</p>

<p>3. MEANING AND USE OF THE PROBABILITY OF FAILURE<br><br>
  The <i>P<sub>&fnof;</sub></i>&nbsp;, strictly speaking, is the total number of Monte Carlo 
  iterations divided into the number of calculated factors of safety with a value 
  less than or equal to one; however, it is common to view the probability of 
  an event as the likelihood of that event occurring. This meaning does not work 
  well for the <i>P<sub>&fnof;</sub></i>&nbsp; of a large, variable landform, because the event <!-- sic evnt -->
  of one failure occurring in a landform or along a proposed road location gives 
  a probability of landslide occurrence of one. It is more useful to think of 
  the <i>P<sub>&fnof;</sub></i>&nbsp; as the relative frequency of failure events in the analysis 
  area or along the road location. The <i>P<sub>&fnof;</sub></i>&nbsp; then can be used qualitatively 
  to make relative comparisons between landforms or road locations to identify 
  areas that should be targeted for additional analysis. The <i>P<sub>&fnof;</sub></i>&nbsp; 
  can be viewed as the probability of landslide occurrence if the area analyzed 
  is small enough (i.e., one slope or one drainage) so that only one failure could 
  physically occur within that area.<BR>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically in hazard assessments for 
  planning purposes, information comes primarily from soils and geology inventories 
  and aerial photo interpretation, with few actual field measurements. In this 
  case, the input distributions represent one's uncertainty about the variables 
  as well as one's best guess about their spatial variability across the landform; 
  therefore, because of the two-dimensional nature of the infinite slope analysis, 
  the estimated <i>P<sub>&fnof;</sub></i>&nbsp; can best be thought of as the likelihood that 
  any possible randomly selected cross-section through the slope would be analyzed 
  as unstable. As more data are available, the probability distributions of each 
  input variable represents more the spatial variability of that variable and 
  less the uncertainty. Here the <i>P<sub>&fnof;</sub></i>&nbsp; should be an estimate of the 
  expected percentage of area of the landform or of the length of the roadway 
  involved in failure during the period appropriate to the analysis &#8212; for example, 
  during the period of minimum root strength following timber harvest, or during 
  the rain or snow melt event causing the groundwater levels used in the analysis. 
  This interpretation of the <i>P<sub>&fnof;</sub></i>&nbsp; can help geotechnical specialists 
  recommend to land managers what level of <i>P<sub>&fnof;</sub></i>&nbsp; is excessive because 
  percentage area or road length in failure can be used to evaluate the possible 
  consequences of failure, such as an estimate of the quantity of material that 
  may impact downslope lands or streams.<BR>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>P<sub>&fnof;</sub></i>&nbsp; estimated using LISA and SARA should 
  be reported as a conditional probability given that the groundwater distribution 
  used in the analysis (which is in part dependent on climatic events and thus 
  has its own probability of occurrence) does indeed occur. The <i>P<sub>&fnof;</sub></i>&nbsp; also should 
  be verified as reasonable by comparison with field observations of slope instability. 
  Used as an iterative tool, LISA and SARA can help the user document personal 
  judgments and observations about an area or road location, communicate them 
  to land managers and to other geotechnical specialists, and help identify factors 
  critical to landslide hazard assessment in a given area. The <i>P<sub>&fnof;</sub></i>&nbsp; 
  also can be used quantitatively in a risk analysis, such as an expected monetary 
  value (EMV) decision analysis. Research efforts are continuing in this area.<BR>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LISA and SARA do not simulate the sizes, numbers, locations 
  or types of failure that might occur (although LISA gives more accurate results 
  for translational failure modes, and SARA can give an indication as to whether 
  the failure mode is more likely to be translational or circular). Therefore, 
  LISA and SARA cannot be used to estimate directly the consequences of failure, 
  such as whether sediment will reach a stream, or the volume of sediment delivered.</p>

<p>4. EXAMPLE APPLICATION<br><br>
  The Clearwater National Forest in northern Idaho planned to construct a road 
  from an existing ridge-top road to the North Fork of the Clearwater River, which 
  flows into Dworshak Reservoir. The proposed road location crossed three landforms&#8212; 
  mountain slopelands (31), mass-wasted slopes (50), and nondissected stream breaklands 
  (60), as shown in figure 1 (Wilson and others 1983). The mountain slopelands 
  consist of the lower and middle slopes of mountains and primary ridges along 
  the North Fork of the Clearwater River. Soil thickness of 1.5 to 2.5m and slope 
  gradients of 30 to 60% were anticipated. Groundwater levels were expected to 
  be high due to concentrated flow by landform shape and low slope position. The 
  areas mapped as mass-wasted slopes were classified based on benched, hummocky 
  topography observed in aerial photographs rather than observations of recent 
  failures. Highly variable soil thicknesses, slope gradients and groundwater 
  concentrations were anticipated. As might be expected, the Forest land managers 
  were concerned about crossing this landform. In the nondissected stream breaklands, 
  soils were expected to be thin (less than 1.5m), groundwater levels low, and 
  slopes steep (greater than 60%). The bedrock underlying the entire area is micaceous 
  schist which commonly produces cohesionless (nonplastic) silty sands and gravel 
  soils. Large differences in shear strength across the area were not anticipated.</p>

 </blockquote>

<p>Based on this inventory information, values and probability distributions were 
  selected for each input variable in the infinite slope equation and the <i>P<sub>&fnof;</sub></i>&nbsp; 
  estimated using LISA; the <i>P<sub>&fnof;</sub></i>&nbsp; values are shown on figure 1 with 
  the landform types. As one might expect, landform 50 (interpreted as mass-wasted 
  slopes) had the highest probabilities of failure with values ranging from 0.12 
  to 0.29. <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relatively high <i>P<sub>&fnof;</sub></i>&nbsp; values and the topographic 
  indications of past failure activity in landform 50 prompted the Forest land 
  managers to request further analysis of the proposed road location. A field 
  reconnaissance of the road location provided measurements of slope gradient, 
  and estimates of soil thickness and groundwater conditions. The road was divided 
  into 12 segments based on similar landform, slope and drainage characteristics. 
  Within each segment, typical cross sections of the natural slope were measured 
  and a self-balanced road prism superimposed. Cut slopes of 3/4:1 to 1:1 and 
  fill slopes of 1.5:1 were used for this analysis. The probabilities of failure 
  for both the natural slope immediately above the road and for the road prism 
  were estimated for each road segment using the SARA program. Generally, the 
  road was well located&#8212;on less steep slopes and avoiding obvious wet areas&#8212;which 
  resulted in lower natural slope <i>P<sub>&fnof;</sub></i>&nbsp; values along the road location 
  than for the landform as a whole. The road location and the resulting <i>P<sub>&fnof;</sub></i>&nbsp; 
  values for the cut-and-fill slopes of the road are also shown on <a href="#Fig_1">figure 
  1</a>.<BR>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there was relatively high failure potential 
  in some road segments, other important factors lead the Forest to decide to 
  proceed with <!-- the --> road project; however, the hazard analysis provided valuable input 
  to the Forest land managers, particularly in increased awareness of the landslide 
  potential, so that possible consequences and mitigation measures could be considered. 
  As a result of this analysis, design alterations were made to reduce the hazard 
  in some segments.<BR>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spring following road construction, 28 cutslope 
  failures and no fillslope failures were observed. One third of the cutslope 
  failures fell into each of three size classes&#8212;10 to 50m<sup>3</sup>, 50 to 100m<sup>3</sup>, 
  and 100 to 300m<sup>3</sup>. The failure locations are shown by the dots in <a href="#Fig_1">figure 
  1</a>. Qualitatively, SARA estimated the likelihood of failure for the cutslope 
  well&#8212;18 of the failures occurred in landform 50 which the model showed 
  to have the highest <i>P<sub>&fnof;</sub></i>&nbsp;; however, there were segments in landform 50 that showed 
  moderate hazard and no failures occurred, and segments in landforms 31 and 50 
  that showed low hazard and 7 failures occurred. We believe the discrepancies 
  are due to inaccuracies in describing the actual in situ conditions. The results 
  of this example illustrate that even probabilistic models provide &quot;good&quot; 
  hazard assessments only to the extent that the input distributions adequately 
  describe actual field conditions. Post-construction inspection to compare input 
  distributions used with conditions observable in road cuts provide invaluable 
  information that then can be used to improve future assessments in similar areas. 
  Feedback of this type is essential for obtaining realistic results. Research 
  is continuing in the areas of updating input distributions using Bayesian techniques, 
  but currently distributions are updated subjectively.<BR>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not addressed in this example, LISA can be 
  used to evaluate the effects of timber harvest by reducing the values of tree 
  root strength and increasing the values for groundwater used in the analysis 
  to model the effects of timber removal (Hammond and others 1991).<br>
</p>
<p>5. CONCLUSIONS<br><br>
  The LISA and SARA programs are tools to assist the user in understanding the 
  factors affecting slope stability, quantifying observations and judgments regarding 
  stability, and in documenting and communicating those observations and judgments 
  to other geotechnical specialists and to land managers. As with any computer 
  program, varying answers can be obtained by altering the input data, so caution 
  must be exercised to prevent the analysis from becoming a game of numbers. The 
  input data should be based on sound geotechnical observations, interpretations, 
  and measurements by qualified individuals who have a thorough understanding 
  of the model; and the results compared to actual field conditions to assure 
  that they are indeed reasonable.</p>
  <p><br>
  The primary advantages of the probabilistic models described in this paper are</p>
  <ol>
   <li>they provide a rational, objective framework for the probabilistic stability assessment of slopes and road ways,</li>
   <li> they allow the user to treat all input variables stochastically,</li>
   <li> they provide a documented plan for how uncertainty and variability are considered, and</li>
   <li> they provide output critical for economic studies and risk analyses.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Because the models are based on geotechnical stability models, they can be 
  used as a design aid, and allow data obtained in geotechnical design and construction 
  projects to be used in future hazard analysis for planning purposes. In addition, 
  the computer programs are designed so that they are easy to understand and use 
  with minimal training in probabilistic concepts.<BR>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programs assist the user in estimating only the 
  landslide hazard; however, the consequences of slope failure (such as the potential 
  for damage to timber and fisheries resources, roads or structures, or the potential 
  for injury or loss of life) should be assessed by the user to provide a complete 
  risk analysis.</p>
