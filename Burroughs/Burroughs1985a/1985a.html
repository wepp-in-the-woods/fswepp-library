  <b>Abstract</b>
  <blockquote>
    The landslide hazard rating system for 
    shallow soils on steep terrain over hard sandstone has three components: ground 
    water response to precipitation, soil shear strength (including root strength), 
    and a factor of safety model. Ground water rise over a hyperbolic-shaped bedrock 
    surface in debris avalanche terrain is empirically derived as a function of 
    easily measured site characteristics. Data on soil shear strength (&oslash; and c) 
    are based on triaxial tests on samples from sites with a high potential for 
    translational failure. Root strength is the sum of the residual strength of 
    Douglas-fir roots as they decline with time after clearcutting and the passive 
    resistance to sliding of an alder soil-root mass. Driving and resisting forces 
    are calculated for a three-dimensional block using estimated ground water 
    rise for a selected design storm, soil shear strength, and estimated root 
    strength.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
Debris avalanches and associated debris 
    slides and flows from timber harvesting and road construction are serious 
    problems for land managers in the Pacific Northwest area of the United States. 
    Swanston and Swanson (<a href="#4"
      onMouseOver="window.status='(3)';return true"
      onMouseOut="window.status=''; return true">4</a>)
    have estimated that clearcutting 
    timber can increase debris avalanche erosion twofold to fourfold compared 
    to undisturbed forest sites, and that road building can increase debris avalanche 
    erosion twenty-fivefold to several hundredfold. Some of the economic costs 
    of constructing timber access roads yet protecting important water-related 
    resources are summarized in a report by Burroughs (in press). Forest managers 
    need techniques to evaluate landslide hazards so that efficient, economic 
    forest roads may be built and timber harvested with minimal impact upon fishery 
    and water resources.

<h3>Site Description</h3>The central Oregon Coast Range is underlain 
    by the Tyee and Flournoy Formations, composed of massive, feldspathic and 
    micaceous, rhythmically bedded sandstones with mudstone and siltstone interbeds. 
    Debris avalanches and debris flows are most common in topography with steep 
    slopes, dense drainages, and colluvial channels extending down-slope at right 
    angles to higher order streams.

<h3>Methodology</h3>The most efficient, generally applicable, 
    landslide hazard evaluation technique has three components: a ground water 
    response model; a soil shear-strength model, including root strength; and 
    a factor of safety model to integrate the results of the first two models. 
    The hazard evaluation model should also use input data easily derived from 
    site characteristics.

<h4>The Ground Water Response Model</h4> The model is the result of a Bureau of 
    Land Management, USDI, field study of those topographic factors and climatic 
    events that influence ground water response to precipitation in linear colluvial 
    drainage bottoms. The study was confined to timber harvest areas that had 
    been clearcut and burned because clearcutting and slash burning is the usual 
    silvicultural prescription in this region. Slope gradients into these drainages 
    range from 70 to 114 percent, and gradients, &#946;, of the drainage bottoms 
    range from 50 to 100 percent.</p>
<p>
    Four pairs of basins were 
    located with basins from 0.22 acre (0.09 ha) to 4.2 acre (1.7 ha). A recording 
    piezometer was installed at the lower end of each basin, and a recording rain 
    gauge was located as close as possible to the top of each basin pair. Data 
    from the 7-day piezometer charts and the 30-day rainfall charts were analyzed 
    to identify distinct periods of rainfall that caused individual ground water 
    rises and peaks. The amount of rainfall (P) that initiates a ground water 
    rise was all rainfall within the 24-hour period containing the rise, and antecedent 
    precipitation (Pa)
    <a
      onMouseOver="window.status='was';return true"
      onMouseOut="window.status=''; return true">is</a>
    that rainfall in the preceding 24-hour period. A 24-hour 
    period was used so that published precipitation frequency studies and local 
    daily precipitation records can be used with the model to estimate ground 
    water response for storms of a selected frequency. </p>
<p>
    Field measurements show 
    that the slope of the ground surface becomes parallel to the bedrock slope 
    a short distance away from the channel bottom. A measurement of the ground 
    slope gradient on a transect perpendicular to the axis of the drainage bottom 
    approximates the slope of the bedrock surface. The mean of the measurements 
    on each side of the drainage bottom is used to estimate tan &alpha; at this location. 
<p>
    Bedrock exposed in typical 
    debris torrent sites has a hyperbolic cross-sectional shape. Figure 1 represents 
    a channel with a hyperbolic bedrock surface supporting soil saturated to a 
    depth, H, and Figure 2 relates the piezometric response, Hp, to H and Hw. 
    The hyperbolic equation can be used to develop an expression for the cross 
    sectional area, SA, of saturated soil as a function of H, as influenced by 
    the slope of the asymptote. <a href="#Fig_3">Figure 3</a> was developed by 
    substituting values of H and tan &alpha; into the equation and plotting the resulting 
    values of SA. For any value of SA, the four curves show how increasing values 
    of tan &alpha; (that is, more deeply incised drainage channels) cause a greater 
    ground water depth, H. SA is a function of basin area, precipitation characteristics, 
    and saturated hydraulic conductivity.

      onMouseOut="window.status=''; return true">abcissa</a>
    of Figure 3 can be viewed 
    as the axis for these major independent variables with tan &alpha; and other site 
    characteristics modifying the basic shape of the ground water response curve.</p>

<p>
    An empirical equation of 
    the form: Hp = A + B*P + C*ln P + D*Pa approximates these general curve 
    shapes and relates Hp to precipitation. Coefficients A, B, C, and D are functions 
    of cos &#946;, basin area, tan &alpha;, antecedent precipitation, and saturated hydraulic 
    conductivity. Because no field measurements were made of the last variable, 
    saturated hydraulic conductivity is assumed to be the same for each basin. 
    This equation was fit to storm data for each basin by linear regression using 
    events with antecedent precipitation less than 0.66 in. (17 mm), the maximum 
    for no ground water response (<a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>). An evaluation 
    showed that basin area and tan &alpha; cannot explain differences in the shape of 
    ground water response curves without using storm intensity. High-intensity 
    rainfall produces a higher ground water level for the same amount of rainfall 
    than lower intensity rainfall (<a href="#1">1</a>). Average storm intensity, 
    Al, for each basin pair was calculated from all storm data and used as an 
    interaction with physical site characteristics in the prediction equation.</p>
<p>
    Coefficients A-D from each 
    basin were then plotted against characteristics such as area, tan &alpha;, and basin 
    length, and width, to develop an empirical relationship of site characteristics 
    to each coefficient. A stepwise linear regression program fit the general 
    model to all field data with a standard error of 0.258 ft (7.9 cm). The model 
    matches data very closely for small to large basins with moderate-to-high 
    values of tan &alpha; in moderate-to-high rainfall intensity zones. Basins with 
    these characteristics have the greatest potential for slope failure and estimates 
    of piezometric response to precipitation are of the most value in stability 
    analysis.</p>

<p>
    Unexplained variance in 
    the test of the ground water model has four principal sources: instrumentation, 
    installation of equipment, measurement error, and experimental error. Calibration 
    of recording piezometers and rain gauges reduced instrument error to a minimum. 
    Data were checked closely to eliminate the most obvious inconsistencies, but 
    some marginal readings were left in the data sets. The major source of unexplained 
    variance is the use of 24-hour precipitation that may contain several periods 
    of rainfall.</p>
<p>
    As the last step in making 
    this model operational, the average storm intensity for each basin pair was 
    correlated with published values of 2-year, 24-hour precipitation for each 
    site. The user can then estimate the appropriate Al value to use for other 
    sites. This empirical ground water response model meets the immediate need 
    for use in an operational slope stability evaluation model.</p>

<h4>Soil Shear Strength</h4> Soils within the study area are well graded, 
    nonplastic, silty, gravelly sands (SM), with 23 to 41 percent gravel, 32 
    to 48 percent sand, 18 to 33 percent silt, and 3.5 to 7 percent clay. Isotropically 
    consolidated, multi-stage triaxial compression tests were performed on undisturbed 
    soil samples at field moisture content and at saturation. The mean friction 
    angle for all triaxial tests, field moisture and saturated, was 36.7&deg; 
    with a variance of 7.32&deg; (Burroughs, Hammond, and Booth, in press). There 
    was no significant difference in friction angle between the field moisture 
    and saturated tests.</p>

<h4>Root Strength</h4> Increased frequency of slope failures 
    following timber harvest attributed to loss of root strength has been well 
    documented (<a href="#5">5</a>). Several models of root strength are available, 
    but each must be carefully examined to determine if the mode of root reinforcement 
    in the model matches the mode of root reinforcement observed in the field 
    on sites proposed for stability analysis.<br>
<p>
    The root reinforcing mechanism proposed 
    for Douglas-fir in the Oregon Coast Range is that of individual soil-root 
    masses joined at their edges by large numbers of fine roots that co-occupy 
    the soil. After the trees are felled, the fine roots around the lateral edges 
    of the root systems rapidly dwindle in number and individual strength. The 
    margins of the root systems continue to retreat with time, leaving only the 
    larger roots in the soil. Burroughs and Thomas (<a href="#2">2</a>) measured 
    the decline in numbers and tensile strength of individual roots for coast 
    Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> [Mirb.] Franco var. <i>menziesii</i>) with time 
    after clearcutting. Test samples were taken from vertical planes midway between 
    trees where the isolation of individual soil root masses would be most evident. 
    Residual root strength after timber harvest was expressed as force per unit 
    area and declined from about 350 psf (16.75 kPa) for uncut coastal Douglas-fir 
    0-0.39 in. (0-1 cm) root size to about 51 psf (2.44 kPa) within 36 months 
    after clearcutting (<a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a>). </p>
<p>
    This Douglas-fir residual 
    root strength model was used for the Oregon Coast Range study site because 
    of the shallow soils over massive bedrock, seasonally high ground water levels, 
    and a translational failure mode. Residual strength presented in <a href="#Fig_5">Figure 
    5</a> represents the average potential root strength. Only 75 percent of this 
    estimated potential strength was used in the slope stability model because 
    not all roots reach their potential strength at the same time during slope 
    failure.</p>
<p>
    The linear colluvial drainage 
    bottoms at the lower ends of basins where ground water accumulates are frequently 
    so wet that Douglas-fir grows mainly on the ridgetops and side slopes. Overstory 
    vegetation in these wet drainages is predominantly red alder (<i>Alnus rubra</i> 
    Bong.) and bigleaf maple (<i>Acer macrophyllum</i> Pursh.). Swordfern is the 
    only major understory component with any significant root strength found in 
    drainage bottoms. These plants grow about 3 ft (1 m) apart with nearly complete 
    ground cover. The force required to pull a fern plant out of a vertical soil 
    face averaged about 35 psf (1.67 kPa) of soil, and was used to indicate root 
    strength for this species.</p>

  <h3>The Slope Stability Model</h3>
    The first effort to integrate ground water 
    response, soil shear strength, and root strength used an infinite slope model 
    of unit width with soil cohesion, root strength, and frictional resistance 
    acting at the base of the soil column. Field checks with this model indicated 
    that the predicted factor of safety was too low. Drainage bottoms in typical 
    linear colluvial channels have a finite width measured perpendicularly to 
    the axis of the drainage bottom from the base of the side slopes (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 
    1</a>). The weakest zone in drainage bottoms appeared to be that length of 
    channel, uniform with respect to vegetation and slope, between points of strength 
    which were one or more alder trees growing in the drainage bottom. A slope 
    stability model was formulated as a three-dimensional block. Block width was 
    equal to the drainage bottom width and block length was the upslope distance 
    from the tree(s) at the lower end of the block to the next tree(s) in the 
    drainage bottom. Figure 6 shows a schematic diagram of the block and the resisting 
    and destabilizing forces acting on it; definitions for these forces are included 
    in the figure.</p>
<p>
    TRS is the total support 
    provided by an alder soil-root mass located at the lower end of the block. 
    Developed strength is the sum of 1) the passive resistance of the soil-root 
    mass and the downslope soil wedge, and 2) resistance to movement generated 
    by lateral forces acting on the unit. Passive pressure was calculated by use 
    of a Mohr diagram (<a href="#4">Ref. 4</a>, p. 426-429) for expected values 
    of Cs, &oslash;, D, Hw, and &beta;. For each combination of variables, the 
    passive pressure at the failure surface and at the ground surface was measured 
    from the Mohr diagram and the average passive pressure, Pr, was the mean of 
    these two values. The user can evaluate the stability of a drainage bottom 
    with or without trees in the block (TRS = 0), and in each case, Douglas-fir 
    growing on sideslopes with lateral roots penetrating the sides of the block.</p>

<p>
    The model was developed 
    to evaluate the stability of drainage bottoms in proposed harvest areas to 
    reflect postharvest ground water response and residual root strength after 
    clearfelling and burning. The user estimates the length of time after harvest 
    to maximum instability considering progressive loss of root strength and the 
    estimated rate of new timber stand establishment. The user estimates the largest 
    expected storm for the period the drainage is at risk, the expected antecedent 
    rainfall, and calculates the average rainfall intensity for the site. The 
    user selects points down the drainage bottom for evaluation, and at each point 
    determines soil depth, tan &alpha;, bottom slope (&beta;), block width, and block 
    length. The user enters these variables together with basin area and precipitation 
    characteristics into an HP-41 calculator program as prompted; the result is 
    an estimated factor of safety. The user performs enough evaluations in the 
    basin using site data at each point to estimate the postharvest stability 
    of the drainage bottom. </p>
<p>
    The model was field checked 
    against existing debris avalanche sites by reconstructing site conditions 
    and rainfall, then entering these data into the model. Sites with an estimated 
    factor of safety below an accepted threshhold compared well with actual debris 
    avalanches. Work is continuing on the effect of bias on estimation of the 
    factor of safety (Burroughs, Hammond, and Booth, in press).</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

    Coast Range can guide development of similar models elsewhere, provided that 
    these models contain three basic components:<br>

     <li>a ground water response model based on site conditions,</li>
     <li>a residual root strength model that matches the mode of reinforcement observed in the field, and</li>
