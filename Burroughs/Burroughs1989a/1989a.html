   <h3>Reduction of Soil Erosion on Forest Roads</h3>
   <h4>Edward R. Burroughs, Jr., John G. King</h4>

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimates on erosion reduction were 
  obtained from selected treatments applied to such forest road components as 
  traveledway, cutslope, fillslope, and ditch. Data from the literature and from 
  in-house research reports provide better insight into effective treatments to 
  reduce erosion. These results should have application to revisions of the &quot;Guide 
  for Predicting Sediment Yields from Forested Watersheds&quot; (Cline and others 
  1981) developed for the Forest Service's Northern and Intermountain Regions. 
  This guide was originally designed as a method to estimate increases in sediment 
  production from watersheds as the result of various land management practices.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Sediment Guide for the Northern (R-1) 
  and Intermountain (R-4) Regions allows a percentage reduction in sediment yield 
  from the total road prism as the result of applying a single erosion control 
  practice, or the application of a combination of practices (Cline and others 
  1981, table 4). These reductions in onsite sediment production 
  from the total road imply a partitioning of total sediment production of about 
  60 percent from fillslopes, 25 percent from traveledways, and 15 percent from 
  the cutslope and ditch. This partitioning was discovered by comparing erosion 
  reduction factors in the guide with the amount of erosion reduction for individual 
  road prism components as given in the literature cited in the guide's table 4.
  New information about onsite road sediment is based on studies by the 
  Intermountain Research Station's Engineering Technology and Watershed Management 
  Research Work Units. These studies show that partitioning of sediment production 
  may be significantly different from that used in the guide and can change as 
  a mitigation measure applied to one road prism component influences sediment 
  yield from other components. This report discusses the potential for reduction 
  of onsite sediment production by various treatments on each component of the 
  road prism.</p>
<p><strong>MITIGATION OF EROSION</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our research and the literature, we have 
  compiled a comprehensive study of the mitigation of erosion from specific components 
  of the road prism: traveledways, fillslopes, cutslopes, and roadside ditches. 
  Because the sediment yields from adjacent components are not directly additive, 
  we need also to review studies on combined erosion control for these areas.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Traveledways</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data on erosion reduction from treated traveledways 
  come from two types of experiments: (1) natural rainstorms and snowmelt on road 
  segments defined by cross drains or dips and (2) simulated rainfall on bordered 
  road segments or small bordered plots. A study of sediment production from treated 
  and untreated road segments subject to natural climatic events was completed 
  by Swift (1984b) in North Carolina. Sediment production in tons per acre per 
  inch of precipitation was measured for bare traveledways before and during timber 
  harvest and also for graveled traveledways subject to light vehicle traffic. 
  These data show that logging traffic on an unsurfaced traveledway can increase 
  sediment production by a factor of 1.90. Our measurements of sediment production 
  from an unsurfaced traveledway in border-zone batholith material with simulated 
  rainfall showed that a surface rutted by a heavy truck will produce 2.08 times 
  the yield of a smooth surface (Burroughs and others 1984). We recommend that 
  the estimated sediment production for a rutted, unsurfaced traveledway be increased 
  by a factor of 2, relative to the yield from a smooth, unsurfaced traveledway.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swift's (1984b) study farther showed that placement 
  of a 6-inch lift of 1.5-inch minus crushed rock reduced sediment production 
  by 70 percent from the unsurfaced condition over a 5-month period. The gravel 
  achieved this amount of protection even though this period included 6.46 inches 
  of rainfall in 5 days. In 13.3 months, the gravel with established grass at 
  the margins of the traveledway reduced sediment production by over 84 percent 
  compared to 9.5 months when the road was unsurfaced.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simulated rainfall was applied to two 100-ft bordered 
  sections of the Rainy Day road, Nez Perce National Forest, built in &quot;border-zone 
  batholith&quot; material of gneiss and schist (Burroughs and others 1985a). 
  One section was left unsurfaced and the other was surfaced with a 4-inch lift 
  of 1.5-inch minus hard gneissic crushed rock. Each section was 13 ft wide with 
  an 8 percent centerline grade and was insloped at 4.4 percent to a standard 
  ditch. Total sediment for the first rainfall application on the gravel-surfaced 
  road section was 64.3 lb from 1.05 inches of rainfall, or 61.2 lb per inch of 
  rainfall. Total sediment from the first rainfall on the unsurfaced road section 
  was 312.1 lb per 1.08 inches of rainfall, or 289.0 lb per inch of rainfall. 
  The reduction in sediment production by graveling this road section was 79 percent, 
  which compares well with Swift's (1984b) results for a section of road protected 
  only by gravel.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other data by Swift (1984a) show that the thickness 
  of the gravel layer is important. Two inches of crushed rock (1.5 inch minus) 
  placed on a road built in sandy loam soil showed no sediment reduction over 
  the yield from an unprotected road. A 6-inch lift of crushed rock (1.5 inch 
  minus) reduced sediment yield by about 92 percent, and an 8-inch layer of large 
  stone (3.0-inch D<sub>50</sub>) reduced sediment production by about 97 percent.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar study in West Virginia by Kochenderfer 
  and Helvey (1987) tested roads surfaced with 6-inch lifts of 3-inch washed gravel 
  (size ranged from 1.5 to 3 inches) and 3-inch crusher-run gravel. Average reductions 
  in sediment production were 88 percent and 79 percent, respectively, over an 
  unprotected road during the 4-year measurement period.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitigation of sediment production by graveling 
  is a function of the erodibility of both the gravel and the underlying material. 
  Erosion reduction by gravel surfacing is maximized by the use of hard crushed 
  rock over highly erodible subgrade material.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measurements of sediment production from surfaced 
  and unsurfaced traveledways were made using simulated rainfall on bounded segments 
  of forest roads (Burroughs and others 1983a; Burroughs and King 1985b). Sediment 
  production was measured on three segments of an unsurfaced road built in granitic 
  materials in Silver Creek, ID, and are compared to two road segments surfaced 
  with dust oil and bituminous surface treatment. Dust oil and the bituminous 
  surface treatment reduced sediment production by 85.3 percent and 96.6 percent, 
  respectively (Burroughs and others 1983a) compared to sediment production from 
  unsurfaced roads. There are drawbacks to each of these treatments: dust oil 
  releases volatile chemicals into surface runoff and the surface breaks down 
  easily under heavy traffic; and bituminous surface treatment is expensive. No 
  good data were found on sediment reduction by lime or magnesium chloride.</p>
<p><strong>Fillslopes</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success in minimizing fillslope surface erosion 
  will depend on the timing of application of any control measure, the type of 
  treatment, the rate of application for mulch treatments, the inherent erodibility 
  of the soil, the slope gradient, and whether or not the road is insloped. This 
  section discusses the effectiveness of various treatments for controling surface 
  erosion on new fillslopes.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most studies that have measured sediment production 
  from fillslopes over time show that, initially, rates in this unconsolidated 
  material are high and exponentially decrease over time (Megahan 1974; King 1984). 
  For example, <a href="#fig1">figure 1</a> illustrates the cumulative fillslope sediment production 
  for the first summer and fall following construction of 1.5 miles of road in 
  the Horse Creek watersheds of northern Idaho. This road was completed and sediment 
  production measurements were initiated in mid-August 1978. The fillslopes were 
  hydromulched, seeded, and fertilized in mid-September. During the first 30 days, 
  about 3 inches of rain fell, which included 5 days with amounts greater than 
  0.3 inches. This was an unusually high rainfall for this period. The average 
  amount of rainfall expected during 30 days in August and September is slightly 
  less than 2 inches. The single largest event was a 0.89-inch thunderstorm that 
  occurred 5 days after the beginning of measurements. Initially, fillslope sediment 
  production was responsive to rainfall, partially because of the absence of mulch 
  and the availability of easily eroded particles on the unconsolidated fillslopes. 
  About half of the total fillslope sediment production measured over a 2-year 
  period took place in the first summer and fall. Thus, erosion control measures 
  that can be put in place immediately after fillslope construction have a much 
  larger potential to appreciably reduce sediment production compared to measures 
  that are implemented later.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If treatment is delayed following road completion, 
  we suggest that the percentage of erosion reduction be decreased. The time delay 
  in treatment, expected precipitation, and armoring effects should all be considered 
  in estimating a weighted sediment reduction percentage.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We analyzed published data and in-house research 
  results to determine how selected erosion control treatments compared and how 
  their effectiveness was influenced by soil characteristics, slope gradient, 
  and ground cover. We identified six treatments: (1) straw with asphalt tack, 
  (2) straw with a net or mat, (3) straw alone, (4) erosion control mats, (5) 
  wood chips or rock, and (6) hydromulch. Figures <a href="#fig2">2</a> through 
  <a href="#fig8">8</a> illustrate the increasing effectiveness of each treatment 
  with increasing ground cover. Of lesser importance in these data sets was silt 
  content of the underlying soil and slope gradient. Generally, the steeper the 
  slope and the siltier the soil, the less effective the treatment. The importance 
  of ground cover in reducing surface erosion for any treatment is apparent in 
  the similar shape of curves in figures <a href="#fig2">2</a> through <a href="#fig6">6</a>. 
  A curve to estimate the application rate for some treatments is also given. 
  For example, to achieve an 80 percent reduction in erosion, estimate the required 
  ground cover from the main curve, then estimate the application rate to attain 
  that ground cover from the application rate curve. For straw mulch alone, an 
  80 percent erosion reduction would require 96 percent ground cover (<a href="#fig4">fig. 
  4a</a>), or about 2.9 tons per acre (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4b</a>).<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated amount of reduction in sediment 
  can only be achieved on smooth slopes with proper installation and anchoring 
  of the material, especially for mats and nets. Rocks, slope irregularities, 
  or gullies prevent good contact between the slope and the material and reduce 
  their effectiveness. The effectiveness of any mulch may be reduced where frequent 
  frost heave or ground ice occurs.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curve for hydromulch shown in <a href="#fig7">figure 
  7</a> does not show the same relationship between cover and sediment reduction 
  as the other treatments. Because it has short fiber lengths, it is easily detached 
  and transported off the steeper slopes by surface runoff, unless some fiber 
  tackifier is used. Dudeck and others (1967) compared the application of wood 
  cellulose fibers (1,000 lb per acre) alone and with an asphalt emulsion (150 
  gal per acre of 1:5 emulsion) and reported about a 35 percent decrease in relative 
  erosion using the emulsion.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a> shows all six treatments 
  plotted on the same graph to better compare their effectiveness.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effectiveness of any mulch treatment 
  can be reduced if traveledway drainage contributes to the fillslope, promoting 
  accelerated rill and gully erosion. Fillslope sediment production was measured 
  with unbordered plots below crowned traveledways at Horse Creek in northern 
  Idaho (King 1979, 1984). Almost all of the larger gullies in the fillslope were 
  generated from traveledway drainage. This process was more dominant than any 
  sheet or splash erosion process. On fillslopes with a vertical height of less 
  than 20 ft, reductions due to seed, hydromulch (1,500 lb per acre), or straw 
  mulch (2 tons per acre) with an asphalt tackifier (250 gal per acre) were statistically 
  similar and ranged from 46 to 58 percent over a 3-year period. The treatment 
  effects were also statistically similar on fills with vertical heights of 20 
  to 40 ft, resulting in only a 24 to 30 percent reduction. For the straw mulch 
  with an asphalt tackifier, the reductions were much smaller than expected because 
  the mulch was not able to protect the fills from concentrated drainage from 
  the traveledway.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeding alone does little to control surface erosion 
  until germination and growth of the new plants, and then only if the seed has 
  not been washed from the slope. Bethlahmy and Kidd (1966) report no sediment 
  reduction from dry seeded and furrowed, steep 1.25:1 decomposed granitic fills 
  in Idaho. In North Carolina, Swift (1984b) collected fillslope sediment data 
  for 9.5 months following road construction and logging, during which the fills 
  were not seeded. These data were compared with the sediment collected during 
  the first 5 and 13.3 months following seeding to show average reductions of 
  7 and 58 percent, respectively, for these periods as grass became established 
  on the fillslopes.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wollum (1962) reported results from seeding and 
  fertilizing a 1.25:1 slope on layered tuffs and breccias in western Oregon. 
  Comparison of sediment measured over 1 year from a 6-year-old bare slope to 
  the erosion from the first year after seeding indicates about a 68 percent reduction. 
  In both these studies the comparison is between preseeded and postseeded erosion 
  for the same slope with no separate control slope measurements. Erosion immediately 
  after construction is usually high and diminishes over time as the easily dislodged 
  material is eroded. Thus, the 68 percent (Wollum) and 58 percent (Swift) reductions 
  in sediment are probably too high because of the surface armoring that occurred 
  during the preseeded interval.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolling fillslopes was evaluated on the Silver 
  Creek roads for layer-placed, sidecast, and controlled compaction construction. 
  A decrease in the infiltration capacity of the slopes due to compaction by rolling 
  probably generated more surface runoff and subsequently more sediment. Average 
  increases in sediment, compared to nonrolled slopes, ranged from 107 to 532 
  percent with an average increase for the 11 plots of 282 percent (Boise State 
  University 1984).<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also evaluated on the Silver Creek road fills 
  was an application of a polymer soil binder. The binder initially formed a surface 
  crust, which was broken by frost action and desiccation. Based on data collected 
  by Boise State University (1984), average sediment production from the four 
  polymer-treated plots was about twice that of the control plots. Because the 
  crust prevents any infiltration, surface runoff is increased and erosion begins 
  in any cracks in the crust. Kay (1984) reports that these crusts will not survive 
  frost heaving nor will uncured crusts survive freezing temperatures.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filter windrows are barriers constructed of logging 
  slash that slow the velocity of any surface runoff, causing deposition of most 
  sediments. They can be constructed on or immediately below the fillslope. The 
  advantage of this treatment is that it can be constructed concurrent with road 
  construction to provide immediate control of fillslope sediment. Filter windrow 
  construction by hydraulic excavator (backhoe) is a cost-effective method to 
  incorporate erosion control into forest road construction. Field evaluation 
  of seven machine-constructed windrows in the Horse Creek watersheds over a 3-year 
  period indicated a 75 to 85 percent reduction in sediment leaving the fillslope 
  compared to adjacent hydromulched slopes (Cook and King 1983). We used data 
  from simulated rainfall on bounded fillslope plots in northern Idaho (Burroughs 
  and others 1985b) to estimate the effectiveness of various erosion control treatments 
  used singly and in combination. <a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a> shows a sediment 
  reduction of about 88 percent by a hand-constructed filter windrow (same specifications 
  as machine-constructed) for the first rainfall. The Curlex mulch is more effective 
  than the filter windrow, but more expensive to apply. For particularly sensitive 
  sites, such as forest roads above streams with high values for water quality, 
  the combination of a filter windrow with Curlex mulch provides about 99 percent 
  sediment reduction. In North Carolina, Swift (1985) evaluated &quot;brush barriers&quot; 
  in terms of sediment travel distance below fillslopes and the frequency of sediment 
  flows. He found that both the average and maximum sediment travel distances 
  were about half as long below brush barriers as below fillslopes without the 
  barriers, and the number of sediment flows per 1,000 ft of road were reduced 
  by about 35 percent.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rothwell (1983) used logging debris placed parallel 
  to the contour and spaced 60 to 120 cm apart on road shoulders, ditches, and 
  cutslopes at three stream crossings. Measurements of total suspended sediment 
  production above and below the road at these three crossings and three control 
  crossings indicated about a 75 percent decrease in storm sediment production 
  as the result of debris barriers.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Travel Distances Below Fillslopes</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the initial rate of fillslope erosion 
  can be high compared to erosion rates on other road components, it is the transport 
  of eroded material below the fillslopes that determines the degree that streams 
  are affected by fill erosion. For most midslope forest roads, only those fillslopes 
  near stream crossings have a high potential to contribute eroded material to 
  streams. The slope distance required to prevent material from reaching a stream 
  is a function of many interacting site and climatic factors, making it difficult 
  to predict with any degree of accuracy. However, sediment transport distances 
  below fillslopes at the Horse Creek and Gospel Hump sites in northern Idaho 
  provide insight into relationships between transport distance and several site 
  characteristics.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1.5 miles of road constructed in Horse Creek in 1978, rills and gullies 
  formed in the fillslopes were inventoried and transport distances measured each 
  spring and fall through the fall of 1980. <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> shows 
  the average transport distances measured in the fall of 1980 for various categories 
  of fillslopes. We excluded from this summary rills and gullies that contributed 
  sediment to streams and rills that displaced less than 1 ft<sup>3</sup> of soil. 
  The average transport distance below fillslopes with filter windrows of slash 
  was about 4 ft. Typically, material was transported over the windrows in the 
  spring when they were partially buried by the remaining snowpack rather than 
  through the windrow. Of the 45 rills that formed in the windrowed fillslopes, 
  only seven had sediment flows below the windrows. The maximum transport distance 
  was 33 ft.<br>
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those situations that resulted in the longest 
  average transport distance were rills formed in slumped material and rills either 
  below relief culvert outflows or rills whose flow paths combined with culvert 
  flow paths. Respective average transport distances for these two situations 
  were 80.4 and 72.8 ft.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most common were rills formed in fillslopes that 
  were not windrowed, had not slumped, and were not influenced by relief culvert 
  flows. The transport distance was influenced by whether the traveledway contributed 
  concentrated runoff to the fillslopes. Average transport distances were about 
  26 ft if not influenced by traveledway runoff and increased to about 59 ft for 
  instances influenced by concentrated traveledway runoff. An obvious rill had 
  to have formed in the subgrade above the fillslope rill before it was classified 
  as influenced by traveledway runoff. Outsloping of the traveledway was not a 
  classification criterion.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These data provide estimates of distances required 
  between fillslopes and streams to minimize transport of fillslope-derived sediment 
  to the streams. These data also illustrate the effectiveness of slash windrows 
  in reducing transport distances and the importance of preventing concentrated 
  traveledway runoff from being diverted onto fillslopes.</p>

<p align="left">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gospel Hump sites are on 25 
  road sections on the Nez Perce National Forest of Idaho (Carlton and others 
  1982). Rill and gully transport distances were measured along a 200-ft road 
  segment at each site the second fall following construction. Additional measurements 
  included the volume of eroded material in each rill, the slope of the fill and 
  the forest floor, the length and height of the fill, the bulk density and particle 
  size distribution of the fill material, the portion of the traveledway that 
  contributed runoff to the fill, and an estimate of obstructions on the forest 
  floor below the road. Obstruction density was a qualitative index from 0 to 
  6 with 6 representing the highest density of obstructions, such as slash, shrubs, 
  and depressions. The reported linear regression model for estimating transport 
  distance using many of these variables explained only 36 percent of the variation 
  in the data. Although this variation is quite large, several important factors 
  become apparent when the transport distance data are averaged for different 
  obstruction index values and traveledway contributions (<a href="#fig10">fig. 
  10</a>). As the obstruction index below the fillslopes increases, the average 
  transport distance decreases considerably. This relationship is an oversimplification 
  because gully size may also influence sediment transport distance. Average transport 
  distance was also affected by contributions of drainage from the traveledway. 
  As shown in <a href="#fig10">figure 10</a>, in most instances traveledway drainage 
  to the fills results in longer sediment transport distances.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cumulative frequency of sediment transport 
  distance for the Horse Creek roads is shown in <a href="#fig11">figure 11</a>. 
  Only transport data from Horse Creek fills that were not windrowed, not slumped, 
  and did not combine with culvert flow paths were used for this comparison. Although 
  the range of sediment transport distances remains similar, traveledway runoff 
  shifts the cumulative curve toward the longer distances. For example, less than 
  10 percent of the rills not influenced by traveledway runoff had transport distances 
  greater than 50 ft compared to about 70 percent of the rills that were influenced 
  by runoff from the traveledway.</p>

<p align="left"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fall of 1980, transport distances were 
  also measured for sediment flow paths below all relief culverts for the 7.2 
  miles of Horse Creek roads constructed in 1978 and 1979. Those sediment flow 
  paths that reached streams were excluded from this analysis. At each relief 
  culvert, additional measurements were made of contributing length(s) of road 
  to the culvert and their corresponding centerline gradients and the gradient 
  of the forest floor below the relief culvert along the sediment flow path. Transport 
  distances were not strongly correlated to any of these variables (<a href="#table2">table 2</a>).<br>

<p align="left">This relationship shows that for the Horse Creek roads, over half 
  of the relief culverts had sediment transport distances exceeding about 75 ft. 
  If the objective is to prevent 80 percent of the relief culverts from contributing 
  sediment to streams, a distance of at least 175 ft must be provided between 
  the culvert outfall and the nearest live water. This relationship probably varies 
  substantially from place to place. However, because of the scarcity of this 
  type of data, this information could be used to estimate leave strip widths 
  below roads on sites similar to those in Horse Creek; gneiss and schist parent 
  material and 30 to 40 percent side slope gradients.</p>


<p align="left"><strong>Cutslopes</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the same variables that affect fillslope 
  surface erosion control are also applicable to the control of cutslope erosion: 
  type of erosion control treatment, application rate for mulch treatments, the 
  timing of treatment, slope gradient and length, and the inherent erodibility 
  of the soil. The literature and other research results provide little information 
  on erosion control treatments designed specifically for cutslopes. The same 
  erosion control treatments may be used on both fillslopes and cutslopes, with 
  the exception of wood chips and rock mulches, and hydromulch, which may not 
  be suitable for steep cutslopes. Research on the effectiveness of these treatments 
  often includes data from sites with slope gradients similar to cutslopes, that 
  is, 80 to 100 percent. We will assume that estimates of erosion control effectiveness 
  given in figures <a href="#fig2">2</a> through <a href="#fig5">5</a> will apply 
  to both fillslopes and cutslopes. Exceptions to this general rule will be discussed 
  where local data, experience, and observations indicate some treatments are 
  less effective under certain conditions.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cutslope erosion processes are often quite different 
  from those on the fillslopes with gentler gradients. Dry raveling during the 
  summer months is a dominant process on cutslopes, especially on noncohesive 
  soils (Megahan 1978). In Oregon, Dyrness (1975) found that dry ravel sediment 
  production of cutslopes in tuffs and breccias was almost as large as rain-generated 
  sediment. Cutslope sediment production from the coarse sand Idaho Batholith 
  soils was usually two to five times higher during the summer and early fall 
  than during the remainder of the year (Boise State University 1984). However, 
  the partitioning between dry ravel and rain-caused sediment was not measured. 
  Bank sloughing when soils are saturated, especially during spring snowmelt, 
  may produce larger soil losses than dry ravel on cohesionless soils. Of the 
  total 2-year cutslope sediment production from border-zone gneisses and schists 
  in the Horse Creek watersheds (Nez Perce National Forest), 80 percent was produced 
  from November through mid-June and 20 percent during the summer and early fall. 
  King and Gonsior (1980) observed that bank sloughing during saturated soil conditions 
  was the dominant process.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for fillslopes, if erosion control measures 
  are delayed following road construction, the first-year percentage reduction 
  in sediment for the treatment should be decreased.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dry seeding alone provides no slope protection 
  until germination and growth of the young plants. However, if the seed remains 
  on the cutslope and germinates, then substantial reductions in erosion can occur. 
  A comparison of Swift's (1984b) sediment production data for 9.5 months prior 
  to seeding and 13.3 months following seeding, liming, and fertilization of the 
  same cutslope, indicates an 89 percent reduction in cutslope sediment production.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrness (1975) measured sediment production from 
  1:1 cutslope plots in western Oregon established on tuffs and breccias. Comparison 
  of sediment production for the first year from the bare control plot and one 
  plot that was dry seeded and fertilized indicated about a 36 percent reduction 
  following seeding. This represents a reasonable expectation for first-year reduction 
  in cutslope sediment provided by grass seeding.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observations on the Nez Perce National Forest 
  suggest that dry seeding is often not successful on 0.75:1 cutslopes unless 
  the vertical height is less than 6 to 8 ft. However, dry seeding will produce 
  good stands of grass if slopes can be laid back to a 1:1 or more gentle gradient 
  (Kennedy 1986). We recommend that a 10 percent, first-year reduction in sediment 
  be used for dry-seeding on 0.75:1 slopes with vertical height greater than 8 
  ft, and a 36 percent, first-year reduction on new cutslopes with a slope of 
  1:1 or less.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First-year sediment reductions for new 1:1 cutslopes 
  on tuffs and breccias in Oregon treated with 2 tons per acre of straw mulch 
  averaged about 85 percent (Dyrness 1975). Three treatments included straw mulch 
  and different seed mixtures, and one treatment was only straw mulch. This average 
  decreased slightly over time, and for the second through seventh year of evaluation, 
  the reduction in sediment averaged 77 percent. The slope length for these plots 
  was 20 to 25 ft.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straw mulch applied with a tackifier is substantially 
  more effective in reducing cutslope sediment production than just straw mulch. 
  In the Horse Creek watersheds, a straw mulch (2 tons/acre) with asphalt tackifier 
  (250 gal/acre), seed (25 lb/acre) and fertilizer application (100 lb/acre of 
  24-16-0) on 0.75:1 new cutslopes in border-zone gneiss and schist material reduced 
  sediment by 32 to 47 percent over a 3-year period (King 1984). Vertical heights 
  of these cutslopes ranged from about 3 ft to over 40 ft. On slopes laid back 
  to 1.25:1, there was little rilling or deposition in the ditch, and the resulting 
  stand of grass was nearly uniform. Sediment reduction on these gentler slopes 
  probably exceeded 90 percent.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goss and others (1970) qualitatively ranked the 
  erosion control effectiveness of various treatments on highway fill and cutslopes 
  and in reducing rill, sheet, and slump erosion for various slope gradients (1:1 
  to 3:1). For 1:1 slopes, these rankings are shown in <a href="#table3">table 
  3</a>. The straw with asphalt tackifier was judged to be effective in controlling 
  sheet and rill erosion, and straw mulch alone was slightly less effective. The 
  ability to reduce slump erosion was rated substantially lower. For straw mulch 
  (2 tons/acre), we recommend using sediment reduction percentages of 35 percent 
  for 0.75:1 slopes and 40 percent for slopes at or less than a 1:1 gradient. 
  If an asphalt tackifier is used with the straw mulch, we recommend 40 percent 
  for 0.75:1 slopes and 75 percent for 1:1 or less steep slopes. Frost heaving 
  or ground ice will displace portions of the mulch and reduce its effectiveness.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the summer of 1985, two types 
  of erosion control mats were evaluated on 1:1 cutslopes with vertical heights 
  of 8 to 12 ft. Observations of the sediment leaving the mulched cutslopes compared 
  to sediment concentration data collected from bare slopes during simulated rainfall 
  suggest erosion reductions of about 98 percent. These tests were conducted on 
  border-zone gneiss and schist material on the Nez Perce National Forest. The 
  trade names of these erosion mats are: MIRAMAT, a plastic net-type mat; and 
  HOLD/GRO, a nylon-reinforced paper mulch. Because these were tested under simulated 
  rainfall conditions, no evaluation was possible of their ability to control 
  bank slough or slumping during saturated soil conditions. Swift (1987) in North 
  Carolina observed negligible sediment from an excelsior mat reinforced with 
  nylon netting placed over a newly seeded cutslope. One concern about the use 
  of erosion mats on cutslopes is whether the weight of winter snowpack will drag 
  the mat off the slope. Our observations of MIRAMAT and HOLD/GRO after two winters 
  showed no displacement on the cutslope. The recommended sediment reduction for 
  MIRAMAT and HOLD/GRO on 1:1 slopes is 95 percent. We assume that mass wasting 
  processes cannot be controlled by these cutslope treatments.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Washington, Goss and others (1970) report effective 
  surface erosion control on 1:1 slopes using jute net mulches and excelsior matting. 
  The performance of any mat or netting will depend on the uniformity of the slope. 
  For example, Goss and others (1970) noticed some rill erosion under jute netting 
  where good contact with the ground was not achieved during application. We have 
  insufficient data to estimate the effectiveness of jute netting. For excelsior 
  mats, we recommend a sediment reduction of 75 percent on 1:1 cutslopes and 60 
  percent reduction on 0.75:1 slopes.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Missoula Equipment Development Center, USDA 
  Forest Service, evaluated geotextile and geogrid systems that could be used 
  for revegetating slopes (Tour 1985). They concluded that unless the vertical 
  height of the slope is under 15 ft, slopes steeper than 1:1 should not receive 
  mat-type erosion control applications. This conclusion was based not on erosion 
  control effectiveness, but rather on time and labor requirements and practicality 
  of application.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terracing is quite effective in reducing the amount 
  of soil leaving the cutslopes. Cutslope erosion may still be high, but eroded 
  soil is deposited on the level terraces rather than transported off the slopes. 
  Megahan (1984) reported that terraced and hydroseeded cutslopes constructed 
  in Idaho Batholith granitics resulted in an 86 percent reduction in sediment 
  production. These cutslope gradients ranged from 0.95:1 to 1.38:1. In California, 
  Wagner and others (1979) showed that laying back a 2:1 highway cutslope to a 
  1.5:1 gradient and terracing the slope in decomposed granitics reduced erosion 
  by about 94 percent. We recommend that 86 percent erosion reduction be used 
  when new cutslopes are terraced.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hydromulching is not very effective on steep cutslopes. 
  Only a 10 percent reduction (not statistically significant at 
<font face="times">&alpha; = 0.1</font>
) 
  in sediment was realized over 3 years on 0.75:1 cutslopes on the Horse Creek 
  watersheds. Vertical heights of these slopes were usually less than 20 ft. Bank 
  sloughing during saturated soil conditions produced more sediment than surface 
  erosion processes, and hydromulch is not an effective control for mass erosion. 
  Goss and others (1970) ranked wood fiber effectiveness on 1:1 slopes low for 
  controlling rill, sheet, or slump erosion (<a href="#table3">table 3</a>). We 
  recommend using a 10 percent sediment reduction for hydromulch on 0.75:1 slopes 
  and 30 percent for 1:1 and less steep cutslopes.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Established stands of dense grass are effective 
  in reducing erosion. An established grass stand has at least 70 percent vegetative 
  ground cover, including plant basal area and litter.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once grass is established on the cutslope, the 
  recommended sediment reduction is 86 to 100 percent, depending on ground cover 
  density. For the sixth through 14th months following seeding of sandy loam cutslopes 
  in North Carolina, the sediment production rates were reduced 97 percent compared 
  to the 9.5 months after construction and before cutslopes were seeded (Swift 
  1984b). In Oregon, an average 86 percent reduction was achieved on four newly 
  constructed and seeded cutslope plots (three plots were also mulched) compared 
  to a control plot, for the second through seventh year after seeding (Dyrness 
  1975). The same treatments on a 5-year-old eroding cutslope resulted in a net 
  soil gain in the second through the fifth year averaging about 0.18 inch compared 
  to a net loss of 1.55 inches from the control plot.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the previously discussed cutslope erosion 
  control treatments will vary in effectiveness from site to site. Aspect, elevation, 
  soil type, and the occurrence of frost heaving may all be important factors, 
  but little information is available in the literature to develop any relationships 
  with treatment effects. Additionally, ditch maintenance may often undercut the 
  slopes, rejuvenating the erosion process. To reiterate, local experience and 
  observation should be used for application of the recommendations in this section.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Roadside Ditch</strong><br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduction of sediment production from road traveledways 
  and cutslopes, through mitigation treatments, allows water with lowered sediment 
  concentration to flow down the ditch. This relatively clean ditch water has 
  increased capacity to detach soil from the ditch bottom and transport it to 
  the stream crossing.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several methods are used to prevent erosion of 
  the ditch bottom, ranging from paving to mats of plastic, jute, or combinations 
  of artificial and natural materials. North American Green (1986) gives results 
  of flume tests of several mats used as channel liners, which show 0.25 inch, 
  or less soil loss with flow rates up to 9 ft<sup>3</sup>/s on a 12 percent slope. 
  These mats reduce water velocity from 56 to 78 percent and protect grass seedlings 
  until the vegetation becomes firmly rooted in the channel section. One disadvantage 
  to these woven mats is that routine grader maintenance on forest roads may catch 
  the mat and rip it out.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most common erosion control treatment for 
  roadside ditches is a rock blanket, or riprap. The D<sub>50</sub>, Dmax, and 
  riprap thickness may be designed as a function of flow rate, channel slope, 
  and channel shape. The design procedure outlined here was based on Highway Research 
  Board Report 108 (Anderson and others 1970) with graphical solutions. These 
  graphs are not convenient to use and their range does not represent forest road 
  conditions. The basic design equations were used to develop a calculator program 
  for a design procedure suitable for forest roads. A flow chart to illustrate 
  the iterative procedure is shown in <a href="#fig13">figure 13</a>. Initial 
  flow depth (<i>d</i>) for trapezoidal channels is estimated by a regression equation 
  solving for <i>d</i> using flow rate, channel slope, channel side slopes, and a Manning's 
  <i>n</i> of 0.03. The procedure also may be used for triangular channels. 
  The procedure calculates the required D<sub>50</sub> for riprap to maintain 
  channel stability for the selected design factors. Copies of this program may 
  be obtained from Burroughs, or the program may be copied from the program listing 
  in the Appendix.</p>

  <p align="center">
  <img src="images/1989a_fig13.gif" width="400" height="463"></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><strong>Figure 13 -- Flow chart for an HP-41 program 
  to calculate riprap D<sub>50</sub> for road ditches.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an example, assume a 500-ft 
  road section on an 8 percent slope draining to a road crossing. The trapezoidal 
  ditch has a 0.5-ft bottom width, a 3:1 side slope on the road side, and a 1:1 
  slope on the cut side. The expected peak flow in the ditch is 0.4 ft<sup>3</sup>/s. 
  Enter Q = 0.4, road slope = 8, bottom width = 0.5, and the two side slopes, 
  3 and 1. The calculated D<sub>50</sub> is 2.4 inches to protect the channel 
  bottom from this discharge on this channel slope.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Environmental Protection Agency report (1976) 
  recommends that the maximum size of stone in the riprap be 1.5 times D<sub>50</sub>, 
  or 3.6 inches in this example. This report also recommends that the thickness 
  of the riprap blanket be 1.5 times the maximum rock size, but not less than 
  6 inches.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major consideration in riprap blanket 
  design is whether a filter is required between the riprap and the underlying 
  material (base). If the D<sub>50</sub> of the base material is too fine relative to the 
  riprap, then flowing water may pull material out of the base and allow the riprap 
  to collapse. A criterion for determining if a filter is required is to compare 
  the D<sub>50</sub> for the two layers:</p>
<table width="27%" border="0" align="center">
  <tr> 
    <td width="40%" height="30"><u>D</u><sub>50</sub> <u>Riprap</u></td>
    <td width="60%" rowspan="2">&lt; 40 indicates that a filter will not be needed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>D<sub>50</sub> Base </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align="left"> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the example, assume that the 
  base material in which the road and ditch are constructed has a D<sub>50</sub> 
  of 1.1 mm. The required riprap has a D<sub>50</sub> of 2.4 inches, or 61 mm. 
  The ratio of these two is 61/1.1 or 55, which indicates that a filter is needed. 
  One layer of plastic filter cloth is usually sufficient to separate the two 
  materials.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this example, the road is to be surfaced with 
  crushed rock with an AASHO standard aggregate No. 4, with a D<sub>50</sub> of 
  about 1 inch. The peak flow rate in the ditch for the upper 150 ft of the road 
  is estimated to be 0.07 ft<sup>3</sup>/s. The design procedure shows that the required 
  D<sub>50</sub> for riprap in the ditch is 1.0 inch. Therefore, the road surfacing 
  material could be used in the upper 150 ft of road and the larger riprap rock 
  used in the lower 350 ft.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Combined Erosion Control on Traveledway, Cutslope, and 
  Ditch</strong><br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little information is available on the integrated 
  effects of mitigation measures applied to separate components of the road prism. 
  Tests by the Intermountain Research Station Engineering Technology project provide 
  some insight into these questions. Simulated rainfall was applied to 100-ft-long 
  bounded sections of forest road built in border-zone gneiss and schist in northern 
  Idaho (Burroughs and others 1983b). One section had a gravel-surfaced traveledway, 
  bare cutslope, and an unprotected ditch. The second section had no protection 
  on traveledway, cutslope, or ditch. Metal barriers and gutters were used to 
  collect traveledway runoff separately from the combined runoff from the cutslope 
  and ditch. Several rain applications were made on the section with the graveled 
  traveledway and unprotected ditch. Then gravel was placed in the ditch, and 
  several more rainfall applications were made to measure the sediment reduction 
  provided by this treatment. Next, gutters and barriers were removed so that 
  traveledway runoff could enter the ditch, and the total sediment production 
  from the entire section was measured over several rainfall applications. Finally, 
  gravel was removed from the ditch so that total runoff down an unprotected ditch 
  could be measured and the increased sediment production determined. 
  <a href="#fig14">Figure 14</a> 
  provides our estimate of the combined effects of a gravel road surface with 
  a protected ditch using the results of these barriered and unbarriered tests 
  on both the gravel-surfaced and unprotected section.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper curve in <a href="#fig14">figure 14</a> represents the sediment 
  production to be expected from a 100-foot road section with no gravel on the 
  traveledway or in the ditch, and an unprotected cutslope in border-zone gneiss 
  and granite. The second curve results from a graveled traveledway and an unprotected 
  ditch and cutslope. Reduction in sediment yield from a 100-ft road section with 
  this treatment ranges from 27 percent for the first rainfall application to 
  40 percent for the last application with an average reduction of 33 percent.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third curve represents an estimate of reduced 
  sediment production provided by a graveled traveledway and a graveled ditch, 
  relative to an unprotected road section. This reduction ranges from 49 percent 
  for the first rainfall application to 67 percent for the last, with an average 
  reduction of 57 percent. The application of gravel to the ditch in addition 
  to the traveledway reduces sediment production by an average of 24 percent. 
  The gravel used to protect the ditch in these tests was the same material used 
  to surface the traveledway, 1.5-inch minus gneissic rock with a D<sub>50</sub> 
  of 0.24 inches. The riprap design program estimated a D<sub>50</sub> of about 1.1 inches 
  for a stable ditch with the flow rate, slope, and ditch shape present on this 
  site. Degradation of the ditch bottom at the lower end of the plot was measured 
  during these tests, which indicates that coarser gravel should have been used 
  to stabilize the ditch bottom. If so, then the reduction in sediment yield provided 
  by graveling the ditch would have been greater than shown by these tests. This 
  also suggests that the unprotected ditch may be a greater source of sediment 
  than the unprotected traveledway, at least for roads with a low traffic volume.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom curve is an estimate of the additional 
  sediment reduction provided by protecting the cutslope. For this estimate, we 
  assumed that the cutslope protection was 80 percent effective and that the graveled 
  ditch did not itself provide any significant sediment. This hypothetical curve 
  was derived by subtracting an additional 80 percent of the sediment production 
  from the graveled road/graveled ditch curve. The estimated sediment reduction 
  provided by graveling the traveledway and ditch and protecting the cutslope 
  averages 91 percent.</p>

  <p align="center"><strong><font size="2">Figure 14 -- Partitioning of sediment 
  yield between components of the road prism.</font></strong></p>

<p align="left">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other items should be noted. The 
  effect of surface armoring is quite pronounced as rainfall and runoff detach 
  and remove fine soil particles and cause a progressively coarser surface texture. 
  Keep in mind that these curves result from simulated rainfall on two 100-ft 
  sections of road. Therefore, these results are accurate only for the relative 
  differences in sediment production provided by various mitigation treatments. 
  The values of sediment production in pounds per 100 ft<sup>3</sup> of runoff should not 
  be used to represent results of natural rainfall or snowmelt.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the simulated rainfall study for 
  partitioning road sediment did not include a bounded section of the fillslope 
  that would have allowed comparison of relative sediment yields between all road 
  features. However, information is available from one instrumented road section 
  at a stream crossing on a similar geology and soils. The road, one of the Horse 
  Creek roads on the Nez Perce National Forest, did not have any erosion control 
  treatments on the cuts or fills, and the road traveledway was unsurfaced. Instruments 
  to measure stream discharge and sediment concentration were installed at three 
  sampling sites along the stream channel (<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>): upstream from the road (station 
  A), at the outfall of the culvert passing the stream (station B), and about 
  150 ft downstream from the road (station C). The road was built in the summer 
  of 1979, and the stations were placed in operation at the end of the summer 
  and continued to operate for 4 years.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig15"></a><img src="images/1989a_fig15.gif" width="350" height="405"></p>
<p align="center"><strong><font size="2">Figure 15 -- Road features and flow 
  paths for the Horse Creek stream crossing with no erosion control measures.</font></strong></p>

<p align="left">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These stations allow for partitioning 
  the sediment by that amount contributed via the ditch system and that amount 
  reaching the stream from the fill slope side of the road. The increase in sediment 
  yield between stations A and B is the sediment delivered to the stream via the 
  ditches, which would include eroded material from the cutslopes, ditches, and 
  a portion of the traveledway. The increase in sediment yield between stations 
  B and C is the sediment reaching the channel from the fillslope side of the 
  road, which includes eroded material from the fillslopes and a portion of the 
  traveledway, plus or minus channel storage. <a hrf="#fig15">Figure 15</a> shows the road features, 
  drainage flow paths, and contributing areas to the stations.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This road section is unusual in that the traveledway 
  is crowned and drains to both the ditches and the fills. Another unusual feature 
  is a berm along much of the outside edge of the traveledway that carries water 
  along it for some length. This water is then diverted onto the unprotected fills 
  in two locations, one of which is directly above the channel. This berm was 
  not a designed feature in the road but was created during construction and maintenance 
  grading. <a href="#table4">Table 4</a> gives the areas of each road feature 
  contributing to the A and B stations. Note that the majority (72 percent) of 
  the traveledway that influences this stream drains onto the fillslopes.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The percentage of the total annual stream sediment 
  that is contributed via the ditch or fillslope side of the road varies over 
  time (<a href="#table5">table 5</a>). During the first year after construction, 
  80 percent of the sediment reached the stream via the fillslope side of the 
  road. After 4 years the situation is reversed, and 83 percent of the sediment 
  is contributed via the ditch system. Over the entire 4 years, 47 percent of 
  the sediment reached the stream from the fillslope side of the road. These results 
  and supporting measurements of fillslope erosion and observation of sediment 
  and water-flow paths indicate that during the first year following road construction 
  at this stream crossing, the unconsolidated fillslopes near the stream generated 
  the majority of the stream sediment. Fillslope erosion was increased by drainage 
  from the traveledway immediately above the channel.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This case study of a bermed road suggests that 
  during the first year following construction, erosion control measures on the 
  fillslopes or immediately below the fillslopes would be more effective in reducing 
  stream sediment than measures to control cutslope and ditch erosion. However, 
  as the less steep fillslopes become armored and revegetated, then the primary 
  source of sediment is ditch and cutslope erosion. The results also suggest the 
  need to avoid undesigned berms that concentrate traveledway drainage and then 
  divert it onto the fillslopes. Insloping the road to the ditch or a more uniform 
  spacial distribution of traveledway drainage onto the fills would considerably 
  reduce fillslope contributions of stream sediment. This would require care during 
  routine blading to avoid altering the designed traveledway drainage such as 
  creating an undesigned berm along the outside edge of the traveledway.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong><br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper provides land managers with a summary 
  of the effectiveness of various road treatments and practices in reducing erosion 
  and sediment transport. We have not included an exhaustive summary of all related 
  research, but we have provided information to improve estimation of sediment 
  yield from roads and to improve the decision-making process. Again, experience 
  and professional judgment are required in relating many of these results to 
  local situations.<br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development continues on methods to reduce onsite 
  erosion from forest roads. This research is now part of a Forest Service study 
  of onsite erosion from roads and disturbed forest sites nationwide. The goal 
  of this long-term study is to develop a physical process model of onsite erosion 
  using easily measured site characteristics with user-selected hydrologic events 
  to evaluate alternative land management treatments. This effort to develop a 
  forest onsite sediment model is part of a larger cooperative effort with the 
  U.S. Department of Agriculture, and Agricultural Research Service, Soil Conservation 
  Service, and U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, to 
  predict soil erosion from croplands, rangelands, and forests.</p>
