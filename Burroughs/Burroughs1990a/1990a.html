  A continuing Forest Service research effort to 
  study onsite sediment yield from forest lands provides information on the relative 
  erodibility of certain geologic parent materials and methods to reduce surface 
  erosion. Simulated rainfall on bounded plots is the principal research tool 
  to generate runoff and sediment from selected sites. This technique is also 
  used to measure the reduction in sediment yield as a percentage of that from 
  an unprotected site. Two types of disturbed forest sites are being studied: 
  forest roads and timber harvest areas.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  Graphs are provided to estimate the amount of 
  erosion reduction by selected treatments on road cutslopes and fillslopes. Percentage 
  ground cover is the principal variable to reduce surface erosion. Where data 
  are available, graphs show estimations of the application rate necessary to 
  provide the required amount of ground cover for a selected percentage erosion 
  reduction. For some treatments, erosion reduction is also a function of slope 
  gradient and silt content in the surface soil. In these cases, an erosion reduction 
  treatment is less effective for steeper slopes and siltier soils.
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  The net result of controlling erosion on the various 
  components of the forest road is not the sum, or product, of the percentage 
  erosion reduction for each component. Research results are used to partition 
  sediment yield from a 100-foot road section consisting of a running surface, 
  ditch, and cutslope. This partitioning shows the expected decrease in sediment 
  yield as each component of the road is protected, taking into account the contribution 
  from the other components. A procedure is presented to design a rock blanket 
  for the road ditch as a function of the expected discharge, slope, and ditch 
  shape.

 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  In the mountains of the Western United States, 
  forest roads contribute an estimated 85 to 90% of the sediment reaching streams 
  in disturbed forest land. There is great public interest in keeping sediment 
  production from forest roads to a minimum because of the high value attached 
  to good water quality and fish habitat. The Intermountain Research Station's 
  Engineering Technology unit is engaged in a series of studies with three principal 
  objectives: (1) to predict sediment delivered to culverts and cross drains from 
  unprotected forest road segments, (2) to develop effective methods to reduce 
  erosion and sediment production from forest roads, and (3) to predict onsite 
  sediment production resulting from slash disposal and site preparation treatments 
  on timber harvest areas. This paper presents results of work on objective 2. 
  Data from the literature and from in-house research reports were used to provide 
  better insight into effective erosion reduction treatments on four components 
  of the typical forest road: The traveledway, fillslope, cutslope, and road ditch 
  (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Our studies have shown that an erosion control 
  treatment applied to one forest road component can influence sediment production 
  from an adjacent component. This means that while the amount of erosion reduction 
  achieved by protecting any given road component may be estimated accurately, 
  the combined effect of erosion reduction treatments on two or more adjacent 
  components may not always be computed directly. This paper will present the 
  measured effectiveness of individual erosion control treatments, then discuss 
  the integrated effects of treating several road components simultaneously.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>TRAVELEDWAYS</b>
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  Graveling the forest road traveledway is a common 
  treatment to improve trafficability in wet weather and to reduce sediment production. 
  The cost of road gravel can be half or more of the total road cost, particularly 
  where acceptable gravel is scarce. Therefore, it is important to know how much 
  sediment reduction is achieved per dollar spent on road gravel.
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  A study of traveledways subject to natural climatic 
  events in North Carolina showed that wheel ruts in all ungraveled road segments, 
  because of the concentrated runoff, will increase sediment production by a factor 
  of 1.9 compared to a smooth unrutted road segment.<sup><a href="#up1">1</a></sup> 
  Our measurements with simulated rainfall on a 100-foot-long ungraveled road 
  segment in Idaho showed that wheel ruts increase sediment production 2.1 times 
  that of an unrutted traveledway. Timely road blading and, more importantly, 
  road closure during wet weather will prevent formation of wheel ruts and will 
  reduce sediment production from the traveledway.
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  The North Carolina study further showed that a 
  6-inch layer of 1.5-inch minus crushed rock reduced sediment production by 70% 
  from the unsurfaced condition over a 5-month period. Simulated rainfall was 
  applied to two 100-foot-long bordered road segments in Idaho, with one segment 
  unsurfaced and the other graveled with a 4-inch layer of 1.5-inch minus rock. 
  This test showed that the graveled segment reduced sediment production by 79% 
  compared to the unsurfaced segment.
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  Two conditions must be observed for effective 
  erosion reduction by graveling the road traveledway: (1) the gravel itself must 
  be resistant to abrasion by heavy traffic and (2) the gravel layer must be thick 
  enough to support the expected vehicle weight. Relatively soft, easily abraded 
  rock may have to be used to surface the traveledway where hard rock is not available, 
  but the amount of erosion reduction may be significantly reduced. The North 
  Carolina study showed that a 2-inch layer of 1.5-inch minus gravel was insufficient 
  to provide any erosion reduction. A 4-inch gravel layer is the minimum thickness 
  normally used in Idaho to reduce erosion from logging traffic. <a href="#fig2">Figure 
  2</a> is a graph of the estimated reduction in sediment yield from 1.5-inch 
  minus gravel as a function of layer thickness. Data came from road segments 
  exposed to natural climatic events in North Carolina and simulated rainfall 
  on a 100-foot-long road segment in Idaho. The predicted sediment reduction increased 
  sharply with gravel layer thickness greater than the 2-inch minimum.
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  Two other erosion control treatments, dust oil 
  and bituminous surfacing, were tested with simulated rainfall on bounded road 
  segments in granitic parent material in central Idaho. Dust oil and the bituminous 
  surface treatment reduced sediment production by 85.3 and 96.6%, respectively, 
  compared to sediment production from unsurfaced roads. The dust oil surface 
  breaks up quickly under logging traffic and also releases volatile chemicals 
  into surface runoff. The bituminous treatment is expensive but long lasting 
  and may be worth the cost to protect stream crossings where water quality and 
  fish habitat values are particularly high.
</p>
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>FILLSLOPES</b>
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  Road fillslopes are generally constructed by sidecasting 
  excavated material onto the cleared right-of-way below the road. The average 
  gradient of these constructed slopes is the angle of repose for sidecast material: 
  about 67% or 1.5:1 (run:rise). The &quot;filter windrow&quot; is one of the 
  most cost-effective methods to reduce sediment leaving the base of the fillslope. 
  Hydraulic excavators (backhoes) can quickly construct a windrow of logging slash 
  (resulting from clearing right-of-way timber) concurrent with subgrade excavation. 
  Cook and King (1983) found that these dense barriers of logging slash reduced 
  sediment that leaves the fillslope by 75 to 85% over a 3-year period following 
  road construction.<sup><a href="#up2">2</a></sup> A test with simulated rainfall 
  of a hand-constructed filter windrow showed an 88% reduction in sediment yield 
  compared to an untreated fillslope.
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  The sediment reduction characteristics of six 
  erosion control treatments commonly used on forest roads were compared: straw 
  mulch with asphalt tackifier; straw with jute, kraft paper, or wire net; straw 
  alone; erosion mats; hydromulch; and wood chips or rock. The percentage ground 
  cover provided by each treatment was the principal variable in estimating the 
  effectiveness of each treatment. Data for these comparisons came from published 
  results of tests with slopes exposed to simulated rainfall and natural climatic 
  events. Figures <a href="#fig3">3</a> through <a href="#fig8">8</a> illustrate 
  the amount of sediment reduction to be expected for each treatment as a function 
  of percentage ground cover and, where sufficient data are available, as functions 
  of slope gradient and silt content. Note that the percentage sediment reduction 
  decreases as slope gradient and silt content increase. Also given is the expected 
  ground cover percentage provided by application rate for selected treatments.</p>

<p align="left">For road segments where the maximum 
  sediment reduction is required, several treatments may be combined. <a href="#fig9">Figure 
  9</a> shows sediment production resulting from simulated rainfall on a bare 
  fillslope and slopes treated with a filter windrow, curlex mulch (wood fiber 
  with nylon netting), and the expected sediment yield with curlex mulch on the 
  slope above a filter windrow. This figure shows several things. First, note 
  the large amount of sediment produced by rainfall on the unprotected fillslope 
  and, second, the rapid decline in sediment with successive rainfall applications 
  as fine material is eroded and the surface armors. The combined curlex/windrow 
  treatment provides an estimated 99% reduction in sediment and would be cost-effective 
  for short segments of fillslope adjacent to a culvert.

  Fillslope sediment production was measured on 
  unbordered plots below crowned traveledways in a northern Idaho research area.<sup><a href="#up3">3</a></sup> 
  Almost all of the larger gullies in the fillslopes were generated by traveledway 
  drainage. On fillslopes with a vertical height less than 20 feet, sediment reductions 
  by seed, hydromulch, and straw mulch with an asphalt tackifier were statistically 
  similar and ranged from 46 to 58% over a 3-year period. The results of these 
  three treatments were also statistically similar on fillslopes with vertical 
  heights of 20 to 40 feet, but sediment reduction ranged from 24 to 30% over 
  a 3-year period.

<p align="left"><br>
  The effectiveness of any mulch treatment will 
  be reduced if traveledway drainage is allowed to flow onto the fillslope. Uniform 
  drainage from a crowned or outsloped road over the length of the road segment 
  causes less reduction in fillslope protection than a wheel rut on the shoulder 
  that collects water and spills it onto the fillslope at one location. Gullies 
  and rills that result from concentrated traveledway drainage can carry sediment 
  for long distances below the fillslope. A survey of sediment travel distances 
  below fillslopes showed an average sediment travel distance of less than 4 feet 
  below filter windrows.<sup><a href="#up3">3</a></sup> The mean sediment travel 
  distance below nonwindrowed fill-slopes without traveledway drainage was 26 
  feet. For nonwindrowed slopes with traveledway drainage, but not culvert flow, 
  the mean sediment travel distance more than doubled to 59 feet. These measurements 
  illustrate the effectiveness of filter windrows in holding sediment at the base 
  of the fillslope.
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  To better understand the influence of traveledway 
  drainage and culvert flow on sediment travel distance below fillslopes, consider 
  the cumulative frequency of fillslopes with sediment transport distances less 
  than or equal to selected distances. Figure 10 was developed with measurements 
  of sediment transport distances below nonwindrowed, nonslumped fillslopes with 
  and without traveledway drainage, but with no relief culvert flow in any case. 
  For fillslopes with no traveledway drainage, about 94% of these slopes had sediment 
  travel distances of 70 feet or less. By comparison, for fillslopes with traveledway 
  drainage, only 48% had travel distances of 70 feet or less.
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  Relief culverts are placed at intervals in an 
  long road segment to discharge accumulated ditch flow onto the natural slope 
  below the road to prevent a large flow volume from entering the stream at the 
  road crossing (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Measurements of sediment travel 
  distances below 70 relief culverts in northern Idaho provided data to estimate 
  the average slope distance required to keep sediment from relief culverts from 
  reaching a stream below the forest road.
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  Over half of these relief culverts had sediment 
  travel distances greater than 75 feet (<a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a>). About 
  85 and 95% of these culverts had sediment travel distances of at least 200 feet 
  and 300 feet, respectively. These data came from sites with 30 to 40% side-slope 
  gradients in gneiss and schist parent material. These measurements for sediment 
  travel distance may not be valid for other sites with different conditions but 
  may provide a rough guide for the design of the minimum width of undisturbed 
  timber between the road and a stream.
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  Straw bales, logging slash, and cull logs can 
  be placed on the slope below the culvert outfall to serve as sediment traps 
  to supplement the sediment-trapping capacity of the undisturbed forest floor. 
  These additional sediment traps may significantly shorten the expected travel 
  distance where the road is close to the stream. Additional information on the 
  effect of obstructions on sediment travel distance below roads may be found 
  in a design guide developed for the northern Rocky Mountains by Packer and Christensen.<sup><a href="#up4">4</a></sup>
</p>
<p align="left"><b>CUTSLOPES</b>
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  Many of the same variables that affect surface erosion control on fillslopes 
  apply to control of sediment production on cutslopes. The literature and other 
  research results provide little information on erosion control treatments designed 
  specifically for cutslopes. The same erosion control treatments may be used 
  on both fillslopes and cutslopes, with the exception of wood chip and rock mulches, 
  and hydromulch, which may not be suitable for steep cutslopes. Assume that the 
  estimates of sediment reduction given in Figures 3 through 8 will apply to both 
  fillslopes and cutslopes because the data sets include sites with slope gradients 
  as steep as 80 to 100%. Exceptions to this general rule will be discussed where 
  local data, experience, and observations indicate some treatments are less effective 
  under certain conditions.
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  Straw mulch applied with a tackifier is substantially 
  more effective in reducing sediment production than straw mulch by itself. In 
  a northern Idaho research watershed, a straw mulch with asphalt tackifier, seed 
  and fertilizer application on 0.75:1 new cutslopes in gneiss and schist material 
  reduced sediment by 32 to 47% over a 3-year period. Vertical cutslope heights 
  ranged from 3 feet to over 40 feet. On 1.25:1 slopes, there was little rilling 
  or deposition in the ditch, and the resulting grass stand was nearly uniform. 
  Sediment reduction on these gentler slopes probably exceeded 90%.
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  For straw mulch without an asphalt tackifier, 
  sediment production was reduced by 35% for 0.75:1 slope gradients, and 40% for 
  slopes at or less than a 1:1 gradient. For straw mulch with an asphalt tackifier, 
  sediment reduction is about 40% for 0.75:1 slopes and 75% for 1:1 or less steep 
  slopes. Frost heaving or ground ice will displace patches of mulch and reduce 
  its overall effectiveness.
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  Two types of erosion control mats, a plastic net-type 
  and a nylon-reinforced paper mulch, were evaluated with simulated rainfall in 
  gneiss and schist material on 1:1 cutslopes with vertical heights of 8 to 12 
  feet. Observations of sediment leaving the mulched sites compared to sediment 
  concentration data collected from comparable bare slopes suggest sediment reductions 
  of 98%. Swift (personal communication, 1987) in North Carolina observed negligible 
  sediment from an excelsior mat reinforced with nylon netting placed over a newly 
  seeded cutslope. Our observations of these mats after two winters showed no 
  displacement on the cutslope by the weight of the winter snowpack. Based on 
  these observations, the recommended sediment reduction for these mats on 1:1 
  slopes is 95%. Assume that mass wasting processes cannot be controlled by these 
  cutslope treatments.
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  Observations of dry seeded sites on the Nez Perce 
  National Forest in northern Idaho suggest that this treatment is not successful 
  on 0.75:1 cutslopes unless the vertical height is less than 6 to 8 feet. Other 
  observers note that dry seeding will produce good stands of grass on slopes 
  with a 1:1 or more gentle gradient. A 10% first-year sediment reduction is estimated 
  for dry seeded 0.75:1 slopes with vertical heights over 8 feet, and a 36% reduction 
  for slope gradients of 1:1 or less.
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  Terracing is an effective treatment to reduce 
  sediment from cutslopes. While erosion may be quite high on the steep terrace 
  face, the eroded soil is deposited on the level terrace floor and not transported 
  off the slope. Megahan (1985) measured an 86% reduction in sediment production 
  from terraced and hydroseeded cutslopes in Idaho Batholith granitics; these 
  cutslope gradients ranged from 0.95:1 to 1.38:1.<sup><a href="#up5">5</a></sup> 
  A California study showed a 94% sediment reduction on a terraced 2:1 cutslope 
  in decomposed granitic material. An average sediment reduction of 86% is appropriate 
  for terraced cutslopes.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  Mitigation treatments that reduce sediment production 
  from road traveledways and cutslopes allow water with lowered sediment concentration 
  to enter the ditch. This relatively clean ditch water has increased capacity 
  to detach soil from the ditch bottom and transport it to the stream crossing.

  Rock blankets, or riprap, is the most common and most economical erosion control 
  treatment for roadside ditches. The D<sub>50</sub>, D<sub>max</sub>. and riprap 
  thickness may be designed as a function of flow rate, channel slope, and channel 
  shape. This design procedure was based on Highway Research Board Report 108 
  (1970) with graphical solutions.<a href="#up6"><sup>6</sup></a> The basic design 
  equations from this report were used to develop a program to calculate the D<sub>50</sub> 
  required to maintain channel stability for forest road ditches. Initial flow 
  depth (d) for trapezoidal channels is estimated by a regression equation using 
  flow rate, channel slope, channel side slopes, and a Manning's n of 0.03. The 
  program calculates D<sub>50</sub> for the triangular ditches without iteration. 
  See Burroughs and King (1989) for a detailed discussion of this riprap design 
  procedure, including example solutions and a calculator program listing.

  An Environmental Protection Agency report (1976)

  This report also recommends that the thickness of the riprap blanket be 1.5 
  times the maximum rock size but not less than 6 inches.
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  Another major consideration in riprap blanket design is whether a filter is 
  required between the riprap and the underlying subgrade material (base). If 
  the D<sub>50</sub> of the base material is too fine relative to the riprap, then flowing 
  water may pull material out of the base and allow the riprap to collapse. A 
  criterion for determining whether a filter is required is to compare the D<sub>50</sub> 
  for the two layers; a ratio of

  D<sub>50</sub> Riprap : D<sub>50</sub> Base &lt; 40 indicates that a filter will not be needed.

 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  Little information is available on the integrated 
  effect of erosion control treatments supplied simultaneously to the road traveledway, 
  ditch, and cut-slope. Simulated rainfall was applied to 100-foot-long bounded 
  sections of forest road built in gneiss and schist material in northern Idaho.<sup><a href="#up7">7</a></sup> 
  One section had no protection on traveledway, cutslope, or ditch. The second 
  section had a graveled (1.5-inch minus) traveledway, bare cutslope, and bare 
  ditch. Metal barriers and gutters were used to collect traveledway runoff separately 
  from the combined runoff from ditch and cutslope. Several rainfall applications 
  were made on each section in its initial condition to measure sediment production 
  from bare and graveled traveled-ways, and other rainfall applications were made 
  with the ditch in a protected and a graveled condition.
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  <a href="#fig12">Figure 12</a> provides our estimate 
  of the combined effects of a gravel road surface with a protected ditch using 
  the results of these barriered and unbarriered tests on both the gravel-surfaced 
  and unprotected section. The upper curve in <a href="#fig12">Figure 12</a> represents 
  the sediment production to be expected from a 100-foot road section with no 
  gravel on the traveledway or in the ditch, and an unprotected cutslope in border-zone 
  gneiss and granite. The second curve results from a graveled traveledway and 
  an unprotected ditch and cutslope. The average reduction in sediment yield from 
  a 100-foot road section with this treatment is 33%.
 </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  The third curve represents an estimate of reduced 
  sediment production provided by a graveled traveledway and graveled ditch, 
  relative to an unprotected road section. The average reduction is 57%. The application 
  of gravel to the ditch in addition to the traveledway reduces sediment production 
  by an average of 24%. The gravel used to protect the ditch in these tests was 
  the same material used to surface the traveledway, 1.5-inch minus gneissic rock 
  with a D<sub>50</sub> of 0.24 inches. The riprap design program estimated a 
  D<sub>50</sub> of about 1.1 inches for a stable ditch with the flow rate, slope, 
  and ditch shape present on this site. Degradation of the ditch bottom at the 
  lower end of the plot was measured during these tests, which indicates that 
  coarser gravel should have been used to stabilize the ditch bottom. If so, then 
  the reduction in sediment yield provided by graveling the ditch would have been 
  greater than shown by these tests. This also suggests that the unprotected ditch 
  may be a greater source of sediment than the unprotected traveledway, at least 
  for roads with a low traffic volume.

  The bottom curve is an estimate of the additional 
  sediment reduction provided by protecting the cut-slope. For this estimate, 
  we assumed that the cutslope protection was 80% effective and that the graveled 
  ditch did not itself provide any significant sediment. This hypothetical curve 
  was derived by subtracting an additional 80% of the sediment production from 
  the graveled road/graveled ditch curve. The estimated sediment reduction provided 
  by graveling the traveledway and ditch protecting the cutslope averages 91%.

  Other items should be noted. The effect of surface 
  armoring is quite pronounced as rainfall and runoff detach and remove fine soil 
  particles and cause a progressively coarser surface texture. Keep in mind that 
  these curves result from simulated rainfall on two 100-foot sections of road. 
  Therefore, these results are accurate only for the relative differences in sediment 
  production provided by various mitigation treatments. The values of sediment 
  production in pounds per 100 feet<sup>3</sup> of runoff should not be used to represent 
  results of natural rainfall or snowmelt.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  Sediment production from unprotected forest road 
  surfaces is high for the first few rainfall events but decreases rapidly as 
  these surfaces armor, as shown in Figures <a href="#fig3">3</a> and 12. Therefore, 
  if a road surface is to be protected at all, it should be protected as soon 
  as possible after construction. Fillslope sediment production measured over 
  a 2-year period in northern Idaho showed that about half of this material moved 
  in the first summer and fall. Erosion control measures than can be put in place 
  immediately after construction have a much larger potential to appreciably reduce 
  sediment production compared to measures that are implemented later.

  If treatment is delayed following road completion, 
  we suggest that the percentage of erosion reduction be decreased. The time delay 
  in treatment, expected precipitation, and armoring effects should all be considered 
  in estimating a weighted sediment reduction percentage.

  This paper provides land managers with a brief 
  summary of the effectiveness of various treatments and practices to reduce erosion 
  and sediment transport from forest roads. The reader is referred to a more detailed 
  description of the effects of these treatments by Burroughs and King.<sup><a href="#up7">7</a></sup> 
  Experience and professional judgment are required to relate many of these results 
  to local situations.
