<p>Simulated rainfall was used to generate runoff 
  and sediment yield from forest roads and fillslopes built in granitic soils 
  to test the effectiveness of various surfacing materials, mulches, and barriers 
  as erosion control treatments. An empirical equation is presented and used to 
  estimate the relative effectiveness of gravel, dust oil, and bituminous surface 
  treatments in reducing sediment yield relative to that of an unsurfaced road. 
  The equation uses road grade, surface density, and the D<sub>50</sub> of loose soil on the 
  surface to predict sediment yield from unsurfaced roads. Gravel, dust oil, and 
  bituminous surfacing reduce sediment yield by factors of 4.3, 7.7, and 91 relative 
  to the sediment yield for a comparable unsurfaced road. Dense grass cover (97 
  percent) on 1.5:1 fillslopes reduces sediment yield by 99.6 percent of that 
  from a bare slope with a loose soil surface. Wood fiber mulch and a sediment 
  barrier of cull logs and logging slash reduce bare slope sediment yield by 91 
  and 87 percent, respectively.</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The impact of forest road construction on water 
  quality and fish habitat is a serious problem for engineers, hydrologists, and 
  foresters. Control of surface erosion is an important and expensive item in 
  forest road construction. But, erosion control is hampered by our limited ability 
  to estimate sediment yield from forest roads and to evaluate the effectiveness 
  of erosion control treatments. This paper describes a series of studies to develop 
  technology for an operational method to design cost-effective erosion control 
  treatments for forest roads.</p>
<p>Simulated rainfall has been used to calibrate 
  physical process models such as ROSED (2), because, among other advantages, 
  a wide range of soils can be easily tested for relative erodibility by applying 
  the same &quot;design storm.&quot; Runoff and sediment yield data from natural 
  rainfall and, especially, snowmelt are needed to confirm relative differences 
  in erodibility found with simulated rainfall. Our research approach is to use 
  simulated rainfall to measure relative differences in erodibility and sediment 
  yield over a wide range of soils and road geometries, supplemented with a few 
  instrumented road sections.</p>
<p>Results from three field sites where simulated 
  rainfall was applied to forest roads built in granitic materials are reported 
  in this paper. Soils derived from Idaho Batholith granites were selected as 
  the highest priority because this material, together with the surrounding &quot;borderzone&quot; 
  of metamorphosed granitics, comprises the largest area of highly erodible material 
  on forest lands in Idaho and western Montana. The sprinkling infiltrometer has 
  been used on forest roads in three Idaho locations: the Silver Creek Experimental 
  Watershed (Boise National Forest), the Rainy Day Road (Nezperce National Forest), 
  and the Horse Creek Administrative/Research Study Area.</p>
<p><b>Rainfall Simulation Equipment</b></p>
<p>A large sprinkling infiltrometer was used to 
  apply rainfall uniformly over plot surfaces at a rate of 2 in./h (5.1 cm/h) 
  for 25-40 minutes. The system consists of irrigation sprinklers on 11-ft (3.4-m) 
  risers supplied by a 250-gal/min (946-L/min) pump from a 5,000-gal (18.9-m<sup>3</sup>) 
  butyl rubber bag reservoir and a 2,500-gal (9.5-m<sup>3</sup>) pumper-tanker. Sprinklers 
  were spaced 20 ft (6.1 m) apart in rows 17.3 ft (5.3 m) apart, with sprinklers 
  in alternate rows offset 10 ft (3.1 m) for more uniform rainfall coverage. 
  A pressure regulator at the base of each sprinkler ensured a constant pressure 
  of 28 psi (193 kPa). This configuration provided a uniform aerial distribution 
  of rainfall for windspeeds less than 7 mile/h (11.3 km/h). Kinetic energy of 
  the applied rainfall at 2 in./h (5.1 cm/h) is about 60 percent of natural rainfall 
  at the same intensity (T. J. Ward, personal communciation).</p>
<p><b>Silver Creek Study</b></p>
<p>Simulated rainfall was applied to six road sections 
  with three different treatments: native granitic soil, native soil with dust 
  oil, and native soil with bituminous surfacing. Test plots of roadway surface, 
  50 ft (15.25 m) or 100 ft (30.5 m) long by about 17 ft (5.2 m) wide, were isolated 
  from the adjacent roadway with barriers sealed to the surface (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 
  1A</a>). Longitudinal slope of the test sections varied from 5.3 to 10.3 percent. 
  Simulated rainfall was applied to the road surface from two lines of sprinklers, 
  one in the ditch and one on the road shoulder. Runoff from the road surface 
  was routed in a metal trough to a flume for measurement of discharge and collection 
  of sediment samples.</p>

<p><b>Rainy Day Road Study</b></p>
<p>Two sections of an existing forest road with 
  an average 8 percent grade were widened, insloped, and graded; the cutslope 
  was shaped to 1:1 backslope; one section was gravel surfaced; and both sections 
  were rolled. Two 100-ft (30.5-m) plots were established, one on the surfaced 
  and one on the native soil section. Gravel surfacing was a 4-in. (10-cm) layer 
  of crushed gneissic rock described as clean 1.5 in. (3.81 cm) minus. A 4-in. 
  (10 cm) layer of the same gravel was placed in the ditch for a series of rainfall 
  applications to measure the relative effectiveness of a protected ditch in reducing 
  sediment yield.</p>
<p>Cutslope height averaged about 12 ft (3.7 m) 
  for both plots. The upper 2 ft (0.6 m) is a silt loam loess material with considerable 
  volcanic ash. Weathered granitic &quot;borderzone&quot; materials of sandy to 
  gravelly sandy loams comprise the lower 10 ft (3.1 m) of the cutslope. No erosion 
  control treatments were applied to the shaped cutslopes prior to this study.</p>
<p>Boundaries were established to isolate each 100-ft 
  (30.5-m) plot for measurement of surface runoff and sediment yield. Within each 
  plot, barriers and collection gutters, were installed to isolate runoff from 
  the road surface from that in the ditch. Two flumes with flowmeters provided 
  a continuous measurement of runoff from the road surface and road ditch-cutslope.</p>
<p>When the barrier and collector were removed, 
  all runoff from the road surface (except for a small triangular area immediately 
  upstream from the road flume intake pipe in the corner of the plot) flowed into 
  the road ditch. Comparison of measurements taken with and without barriers allowed 
  calculation of the contribution of the road surface and ditch-cutslope to total 
  runoff and sediment yield from the plot. Water and sediment yield from the road 
  surface and the ditch-cutslope were separately monitored for 14 simulated rainfall 
  applications (runs). The combined runoff from the road surface and the ditch-cutslope 
  was monitored for another 15 runs. Simulated rainfall was applied to each plot 
  by three rows of sprinklers, one on the road shoulder, one in the ditch, and 
  one at the top of the cut-slope (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1B</a>).</p>
<p><b>Horse Creek Study</b></p>
<p>A 70-ft (21.3-m) section of fillslope along an 
  existing road was isolated (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1C</a>) for measurement of 
  erosion control provided by (1) a dense stand of grass, (2) a wood fiber mulch, 
  and (3) a sediment barrier of logging slash. The fillslope averaged 67 percent 
  (1.5:1) and was covered with a 6-year-old stand of grass, principally orchardgrass 
  and smooth brome, planted for erosion control. The plot had 97 percent ground 
  cover of standing grass, litter, and stones greater than 0.25 in. (6.4 mm) in 
  diameter. The plot, with grass undisturbed, was treated with four applications 
  of simulated rainfall and all runoff was collected and routed to a flume for 
  measurement and sediment sampling.</p>
<p>Grass and litter were stripped from the plot 
  and loose soil from the cutslope was spread over the fillslope to simulate a 
  newly constructed fill. After four applications of simulated rainfall, loose 
  soil was again spread over the surface and a mulch of wood excelsior with a 
  nylon net was pinned to the fillslope. The mulch was removed after four applications 
  of simulated rainfall and a &quot;filter windrow&quot; was constructed on the 
  lower half of the fillslope of cull logs and fresh logging slash immediately 
  above the collection trough. Construction of this sediment barrier followed 
  specifications described by Cook and King (<a href="#ref_1">1</a>). Loose soil 
  was spread over the fillslope above the filter windrow and four applications 
  of simulated rainfall were made.</p>
<p><b>Data Collected</b></p>
<p>Soil samples were taken from each plot in each 
  study area to characterize the road and to determine sediment yield prediction 
  variables. Samples were taken of: bulk density by 0.1-ft (3-cm) depth increments 
  to 0.3 ft (9 cm) below the road surface; loose soil in lb/ft<sup>2</sup> (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) 
  on each road surface before each simulated rainfall collected by vacuuming four 
  to six randomly located plots; gravimetric soil moisture by depth increments 
  at randomly located points before and immediately after each simulated rainfall. 
  Particle-size gradation was determined for each density, loose surface soil, 
  and suspended sediment sample.</p>
<p>Runoff-related data collected for each test included 
  a record of the time simulated rain began, time to surface ponding, time simulated 
  rainfall ceased, a continuous recording of flume stage, time each sediment sample 
  was taken (1-min intervals for the rising limb of the hydrograph and 2-min intervals 
  thereafter), signals from two tipping bucket rain gauges, and the increment 
  of time when wind velocities exceeded 400 ft/min (122 m/min) . All data were 
  recorded on an eight-channel digital data logging system, with a chart recorder 
  as a backup system for signals from each flowmeter.</p>
<p><b>Relative Effectiveness of Road Surfacing</b></p>
<p>Plot descriptive data and sediment yield measurements 
  were closely scrutinized to identify items of questionable quality caused by 
  either leakage at a plot boundary or instrument malfunction. Questionable data 
  were not used in any analysis. <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> gives plot descriptions, 
  soil properties, and sediment yield from measurements taken of runoff from road 
  surfaces. Stepwise linear regression was used to develop the relationship between 
  sediment yield from unsurfaced roads as a function of road gradient and soil 
  properties (<a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>); the amount of loose soil was not a 
  significant variable. The last column in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> gives 
  the estimated value of sediment yield from unsurfaced roads using the prediction 
  equation.</p>
<p>The relative effectiveness of road surfacing 
  can be estimated from Figure 2. Sediment yield from a graveled road surface 
  is about 23 percent of the yield from an unsurfaced road with Rainy Day conditions 
  at the same gradient. Sediment yield from dust-oiled and bituminous-treated 
  road surfaces are about 13 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively, of the yield 
  from an unsurfaced road with Silver Creek conditions at the same gradient.<br>

<p><b>Relative Effectiveness of Rocked Ditches</b></p>
<p>Runoff and sediment yield were measured from 
  a set of four simulated rainfall applications in each of these plot conditions: 
  unrocked ditch with barriers in place between ditch and road surface; rocked 
  ditch with barriers; rocked ditch unbarriered; unrocked ditch unbarriered. Relative 
  sediment yield production is the ratio of total sediment yield from unrocked 
  ditches to total sediment yield from rocked ditches using data from barriered 
  and unbarriered runs. The mean sediment production for unrocked ditches is 2.3 
  times that for rocked ditches, both with unprotected cutslopes.</p>
<p><b>Relative Effectiveness of Erosion Control on Fillslopes</b></p>
<p>Average sediment yield for the four runs on the 
  stripped fill-slope with a loose soil surface in the Horse Creek site was 116.7 
  lb/1,000 ft<sup>2</sup> (57.0 kg/100 m<sup>2</sup>). Average sediment yield, 
  expressed in lb/1,000 ft<sup>2</sup> (kg/100 m<sup>2</sup>), for the undisturbed grass 
  cover, wood fiber mulch, and the filter windrow was: 0.52 (0.25), 10.5 (5.13), 
  and 15.3 (7.48), respectively.</p>
<p><b>Summary and Conclusions</b></p>
<p>Estimating sediment produced by the road surface, ditch, and cutslope is extremely 
  important because of the potential impact on water quality of live streams by 
  ditch flow. Our studies show that sediment from road surfaces can be significantly 
  reduced: by a factor of 4.3 for gravel surfacing, 7.7 for dust oil, and 91 for 
  bituminous surfacing. The prediction equation (<a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>) 
  estimates the weight of sediment from unsurfaced roads with acceptable accuracy 
  for the Silver Creek granitic materials and the less erodible metamorphosed 
  granitics at the Rainy Day site.</p>
<p>The simulated rainfall tests were conducted without the influence of traffic, 
  which would break down the surfacing and provide loose material for transport 
  by the next rainfall. The rapid armoring effects seen in these studies may not 
  be realized on similar road surfaces subjected to traffic.</p>
<p>Results of measurements of fillslope protection treatments show that both wood 
  fiber mulch and the filter windrow provide good immediate protection following 
  road construction until planted grass can become established. Measurements of 
  the sediment yield below filter windrows for at least 3 years after construction 
  (1) indicate that these sediment barriers will remain effective until grass 
  is established. Continued observation has shown that these barriers have remained 
  effective for the 7 years since construction.</p>
<p>These studies do not reflect the type of detachment and transport processes 
  that occur during natural rainfall because of the difference in kinetic energy 
  in simulated versus natural rainfall at the same intensity. Sediment yields 
  measured during simulated rainfall will, of course, be entirely different from 
  sediment yield caused by snowmelt. Therefore, these data should not be used 
  to estimate seasonal or annual sediment production.</p>
<p>Sediment and water yields measured in these studies are site specific and these 
  values are for the particular site conditions tested. The estimates of relative 
  effectiveness developed here are probably realistic for batholith and borderzone 
  materials in this portion of the Northern Rocky Mountains.</p>
