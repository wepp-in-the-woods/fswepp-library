  Deterministic Level I Stability Analysis (DLISA) and probabilistic Level I Stability 
  Analysis (LISA) models provide information for a slope stability analysis. These 
  computer codes have been developed, tested, and validated by U. S. Department 
  of Agriculture Forest Service researchers. The purpose of this research was 
  to provide engineers and scientists a personal computer program for evaluating 
  potential slope instability within planning areas in forested uplands. Physical 
  soil values within the infinite slope equation are evaluated within DLISA for 
  possible frequency distributions. LISA, the probabilistic computer program, 
  adds a stochastic simulation by the Monte Carlo method of these frequency distributions. 
  The result from these analyses is a probability of slope failure. Potential 
  shallow landslides, such as debris flows, have been evaluated since 1987 and 
  can be predicted with DLISA and LISA.</font></p>

 <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></h4>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  Researchers have applied the infinite slope equation as the governing equation 
  for evaluating shallow landslides on long hill slopes, and for studying the 
  mechanics of these landslides on forested uplands (Pierson, 1977; Beschta, 1981; 
  Sidle and Swanston, 1982; Burroughs, 1984; Dietrich et al., 1986; Benda and 
  Dunne, 1987; Benda, 1988; Reneau, 1988; Benda, 1990; and Benda, 1994). Similar 
  work has also been completed near urban areas within the San Francisco Bay area 
  (Nilsen et al., 1976; Wieczorek, 1982). The role of vegetation to slope stability, 
  including the effect of tree root strength and tree surcharge (O'Loughlin, 
  1974; Swanston, 1974; Ziemer and Swanston, 1977; Burroughs and Thomas, 1977; 
  Ziemer, 1981; O'Loughlin and Ziemer, 1982; and Greenway, 1987), has been identified 
  in these studies as an important component of overall hill slope stability. 
  Several models have resulted from these studies and are used by practitioners 
  for natural resource agencies, counties, municipalities, and consulting companies.</p>
  <p>
   The deterministic (DLISA) and probabilistic Level 
  I stability analysis (LISA) computer codes are models intended to predict landslide 
  hazards for planning areas that are typically several square miles in area (Hammond 
  et al., 1992). Level I is the first in a three-level system developed by Prellwitz 
  (1985) and used by many geotechnical specialists in the U.S. Department of 
  Agriculture, Forest Service (Koler and Neal, 1989; Koler, 1993; and Prellwitz 
  and Koler, 1994). Level II is for evaluating a pre-construction road corridor, 
  and Level III is for site-specific analysis within a road prism or proposed 
  timber harvest sale unit. The infinite slope equation is the governing equation 
  in DLISA, LISA and Level II stability analyses. The method of slices equations 
  are the governing equations in the Level III stability analysis. The typical 
  scales used for mapping are 1:24,000 for Level I, 1:3,600 for Level II and 1:120 
  for Level III. DLISA and LISA are distributed together along with the user 
  guide (Hammond et al., 1992), are within the public domain, and are available 
  from the author. The programs have also been distributed through the Internet's 
  sci.engr.geomechanics USENET newsgroup, and are available through the Internet 
  World Wide Web page with the address of https://forest.moscowfsl.wsu.edu/engr/lisa0.html.</p>
<p>
   The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the 
  use of DLISA and LISA codes to predict debris flow activity. An example is provided, 
  with data from a slope stability hazard assessment near Leavenworth, Washington, 
  to illustrate how to apply these two models.</font></p>

    The computer code DLISA solves the infinite slope equation for soil depth, 
    surface slope, root cohesion, tree surcharge (weight of trees applied uniformly 
    over the slope), ground-water ratio (ratio of the depth of water to the depth 
    of soil), friction angle, soil cohesion, and factor of safety (Hammond et 
    al., 1991a). A common application of DLISA is a sensitivity analysis to identify 
    the most important variables of the infinite slope equation using a method 
    developed by Simons and others (1978). Another common application is to determine 
    soil depths where soil inventories are lacking this information. These soil 
    depths are then included in analyses by foresters, soil scientists, hydrologists, 
    and other resource scientists. Similar work can also be done for slope, ground-water 
    ratio, and other parameters. <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> displays the geometry 
    of these parameters.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>LISA DESCRIPTION</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    The probabilistic computer code LISA enables the user to compute the probability 
    of slope failure using up to 1,000 iterations of a Monte Carlo simulation 
    by varying the input values to the infinite slope equation (Hammond et al., 
    1991b). DLISA and LISA use the same parameters. In preparing parameter data 
    for LISA input, the user defines the statistical distribution of the parameter 
    values, which vary spatially, temporally, and with uncertainty (data gaps 
    and resolution). There are several ways to display the data distributions 
    and to incorporate within the probability analysis. These distributions include 
    uniform, triangular, normal, lognormal, beta, and histogram. Constant values 
    also may be used. A bivariate normal distribution is available in the program 
    for modeling the correlation between soil cohesion and friction angle. The 
    <em>FOS</em> derived from LISA is conditional because parameters do not remain 
    static.</font></p>

  </p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    The user guide for LISA explains in detail 
    how the program works (Hammond et al., 1992). The LISA user follows these 
    general steps after polygons (areas of similar soils and slope conditions) 
    have been delineated for a study area: <br>
    </font></p>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The user selects a distribution 
    type for each input parameter in the infinite slope equation and then enters 
    the values to describe that distribution. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For each input parameter 
    LISA samples up to 1,000 values from the user-specified probability density 
    function (distribution). This results in a table of up to 1,000 combinations 
    of input parameter values.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> LISA then calculates 
    the <em>FOS</em> for each set of generated values. The result is the possible 
    realizations of the <em>FOS</em>. Relative frequencies are a result of the 
    distributions used for each input variable. The minimum, maximum, mean, and 
    standard deviation for the calculated <em>FOS</em> and the probability of 
    failure (percentage of <em>FOS</em>&le;1) are determined and displayed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The user then may view 
    the frequency histogram of the <em>FOS</em> values. The values simulated for 
    each variable may be viewed in several ways. For example, scatter plots can 
    be generated for any pair of input variables, or of an input variable and 
    the <em>FOS</em>.<br>
    </font></li>
</ol>

<h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>DLISA AND LISA APPLICATION</b></font></h4>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  Realistic input parameter values are usually taken from such available resources 
  as field reconnaissance data, soil inventories, landslide inventories, maps, 
  and files for the study area. Frequently, there are gaps in this information, 
  and the user will need to establish a level of confidence for the data that 
  fill these gaps. Figures and tables in the LISA user guide suggest values for 
  each of the variables or relationships.</p>
  <p>
  The spatial distribution of values being evaluated 
  is important in completing a sensitivity analysis. Usually, concave, gentle 
  slopes have deeper soils than do convex, steep slopes; soil depth on planar 
  slopes is somewhere between. Areas of tree mortality from wildfire, insect infestation, 
  disease, and timber harvesting influence the spatial distribution of tree root 
  strength and tree surcharge. Because values may vary widely over a given area, 
  the specialist will need to divide the study area into polygons where variable 
  distribution values are spatially similar. The LISA computer program can then 
  evaluate the values for each polygon.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  Information obtained from LISA is commonly used by Forest Service professionals 
  to complete a hazard/risk analysis. The results from this analysis can be incorporated 
  in a report to help resource managers in their decision-making activities. These 
  decisions are usually for forest plans, watershed analyses, and proposed timber 
  sales.</p>
  <p>
  Both professionals and managers often confuse the relationship between a LISA 
  probability and a hazard/risk assessment. Hazards are the natural geologic conditions 
  that have slope movement potential. Resource risks such as fish and wildlife 
  habitat, water quality, roads, structures, and scenery have the potential to 
  be affected by the hazards (Koler, 1994). Risk can be described as a function 
  of both probability and consequence (Remboldt, 1995):</font></p>

  <blockquote>
   <table width=85%>
    <tr>

  </blockquote>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  A probability of failure is not assigned to an actual landslide site within 
  the evaluated polygon in LISA. LISA also does not address the size or consequence 
  of the failure. It does, however, give a polygon landslide probability that 
  when used with consequences may provide a risk assessment. Consequences can 
  include loss of life, personal injury, property damage and loss, degradation 
  of fish and wildlife habitat, increased maintenance costs, and mitigation costs. 
  Some Forest Service professionals will assign a monetary value for consequence 
  and multiply it by the LISA probability to predict a risk for roads, structures, 
  and municipal watersheds. Risk is more difficult to predict for other resources 
  such as visual aesthetics and wildlife habitat. Four steps are necessary to 
  complete a hazard/risk assessment:
  <ol>
   <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Identify the potential geologic hazard.</font></li>
   <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Obtain the LISA probability for an area (polygon).</font></li>
   <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Identify the consequence to resources within the polygon.</font></li>
   <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Assign or calculate a risk value as a function of probability and consequence.</font></li>
  </ol>

  A LISA probability will not identify where a landslide will occur at a specific 
  site within a polygon. However, the code can be used with historical records 
  (such as aerial photographs, weather data, road construction and maintenance 
  records) to find a probability threshold for possible debris flow activity. 
  This probability threshold can then be used in conjunction with other models 
  to determine the possible initiation of debris flow activity and location of 
  deposition.</p>
  <p>
  The missing piece in LISA is the role of rainfall 
  and antecedent moisture relative to incipient slope movement. By integrating 
  available rainfall and antecedent moisture models with DLISA and LISA, the resolution 
  for the probability threshold can be increased. It then may be feasible to predict 
  the timing of incipient slope movement.
  Possible existing methods for this integration 
  are those described by Nilsen and others (1976), Mark and Newman (1990), and 
  Wilson and Wieczorek (1995). Possible runout distance and deposition from this 
  debris flow activity can then be predicted with the Benda-Cundy model (Benda and Cundy, 1990).</font></p>

 <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>PREDICTING POSSIBLE AREAS OF DEBRIS FLOW ACTIVITY</b></font></h4>

 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  Forest Service engineers, geologists, and resource scientists identify and predict 
  possible debris flow activity with DLISA and LISA (for example, Koler et al., 
  1995). These specialists provide resource managers with a scientifically valid 
  analysis and minimize the subjectivity that can occur in slope stability work 
  at the planning scale (1:24,000). For example, many debris flows are initiated 
  within concave-shaped slopes, but not all concave slopes have the right materials 
  and conditions for incipient movement. This analysis is a process to eliminate 
  possible debris flow initiation sites. There are seven steps in this process:

 <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>CASE STUDY OF DLISA AND LISA APPLICATION</b></font></h4>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  The example site is on Tumwater Mountain near Leavenworth in central Washington 
  (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). Koler and others (1995) evaluated this area 
  for potential slope stability hazards that may result from the 1994 wildfire. 
  The Wenatchee National Forest, Washington State Department of Transportation, 
  Chelan County, and the city of Leavenworth are applying information from this 
  study in their planning projects.</p>
  <p>
  Tabor and others (1987) mapped the bedrock in 
  this area as Mesozoic plutonic rock (primarily granite, granodiorite, and tonalite) 
  in contact with metamorphic rock (mostly schist).
  Trees are
  Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>),
  ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>), and
  grand fir (<i>Abies grandis</i>). 
  Soils were classified in the field and in the laboratory, using the Unified 
  Soil Classification System (after Howard, 1984), as silty sands and gravel with 
  no or little plasticity (SM and GM). In many areas, the trees were killed by 
  wildfire. In some locations, the trees and roots were completely removed by 
  wildfire, leaving behind soil macropores (Figure 3). Field crews measured several 
  cross sections across the slopes mapping subsurface materials and conditions. 
  From this fieldwork the average slope angle, in most areas, was about 33&deg;.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
  Several assumptions are made for step 1.
  Silty sands and gravels with little or no plasticity usually have an average dry unit 
  weight of 100 pounds/square ft (psf), a moisture content of 0.25, an angle of 
  internal friction between 27&deg; and 33&deg;, and soil cohesion of 0 to 40 
  psf (Terzaghi and Peck, 1967; Hammond et al., 1992). In this example, we assume 
  an average of 30&deg; for friction angle, and an average of 20 psf for soil 
  cohesion. An average tree surcharge of 25 psf and root cohesion of 88 psf is 
  also assumed (Greenway, 1987; Hammond et al., 1992).</p>
  <p>
  In step 2, DLISA solves for soil depth for various 
  slope angles by varying the ground-water ratio, by keeping other values constant, 
  and by assigning an <em>FOS</em> of 1.0. Results from step 2 (<a href="#table1">Table 
  1</a>) show that for slope angles less than the average slope of 33&deg;, soil 
  depths are quite thick, even for an <em>FOS</em> of 1.0. Also, for high ground-water 
  ratios (&gt;0.5), soil depths do not drop to 5 ft or less until the slope angles 
  are greater than 31&deg;.</font></p>

  Most areas reconnoitered had soil depths less 
  than 5 ft, and in many areas the depths averaged 2.5 ft. The soil resource inventory 
  for the Wenatchee National Forest also shows soil depths of less than 5 ft. 
  It seems unlikely that deeper soils occur on these slopes. Step 3 may seem simplistic 
  and unnecessary, but frequently an error will occur because of the &quot;black 
  box effect&quot; (if the model says so, it must be fact). <a href="#fig4">Figure 
  4</a> shows a lognormal distribution curve for soil depths estimated in step 
  3. These depths are derived from judgment of the engineer or scientist to cover 
  the reasonable values from <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>. A lognormal curve 
  was selected because some portions of the slopes on Tumwater Mountain are concave, 
  and it is quite possible that in these areas the soil depths may reach 4 to 
  5 ft.</font></p>

  For step 4, DLISA runs were completed using soil 
  depths of 3, 4, and 5 ft (Tables <a href="#table2">2</a>, <a href="#table3">3</a>, 
  and <a href="#table4">4</a>). In Tables 2 through 4, a ground-water ratio is 
  given for each <i>FOS</i> and slope angle. For example, in Table 2 there is a preponderance 
  of ground-water ratios with values of 1.0. This indicates the ground-water depth 
  is equal to the soil depth. Or in other words, <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> 
  shows 3-ft-deep soils on most slope angles can be saturated (or nearly so) and 
  remain stable. Slope failure does not occur until the slope angle is 39&deg; 
  or greater and the ground-water ratio ranges from 0.48 to 0.96. This stability 
  may be because of the presence of tree roots. Local historical information (aerial 
  photographs, road maintenance records, newspaper articles, and resident surveys) 
  indicates that most debris flow activity occurs when root strength is lowered 
  (for example, by wildfire and disease). It is also well documented in the literature 
  that root strength is a significant factor in shallow soil stability. Tables 
  <a href="#table3">3</a> and <a href="#table4">4</a>, however, show 4- and 5-ft-deep
  soils on steep slopes (&gt;35&deg;) are sensitive to increases in soil 
  moisture. In these cases trace amounts of moisture (0.00 to 0.08 ground-water 
  ratios) are sufficient for failure to occur on 45&deg; hill slopes. For hill 
  slopes with slope angles ranging from 35&deg; to 42&deg; the ground-water ratios 
  are higher for unstable conditions and range from 0.16 to 0.80. It appears that 
  the presence of vegetation on slopes with deeper soils is not as important as 
  it is with the 3-ft-deep soils.</font></p>

  Frequency distributions for ground-water ratio, tree surcharge after disturbance, 
  and root cohesion after disturbance are selected in step 5. For example, the 
  user will need to build frequency distributions for each slope angle (or ranges 
  of slope angles) because the ground-water ratio will fluctuate differently for 
  gentle gradient slopes than it will for steep slopes. <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a> shows a histogram 
  distribution for the ground-water ratio of several steep slope gradients (70, 
  80, 90, and 100 percent) that were summed for the histogram. Although a histogram 
  was used in this case, the LISA operator may wish to describe the frequency 
  distribution with another type of curve (e.g., uniform, triangular, normal, 
  lognormal, and beta).</font></p>

  Figures <a href="#fig6">6</a> and <a href="#fig7">7</a> show lognormal distributions 
  for tree surcharge and root cohesion after some form of disturbance, such as 
  wildfire, disease, and timber harvesting. Based on field observations in this 
  example, the average tree surcharge was reduced by almost 75 percent. Complete 
  tree loss occurred in some areas (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). The distribution 
  for tree surcharge is lognormal because in some protected pockets on slopes,
  the trees were not burned as intensely as in other areas. Therefore, the tree
  surcharge in these areas is closer to the preburn (undisturbed) value of 40 
  psf. A similar logic was used in establishing the distribution for root cohesion. 
  However, the average root cohesion value was reduced by more than 75 percent 
  of the preburn value because brush vegetation, which contributes greatly to 
  the root strength value, has a higher mortality from wildfire.</p>
  <p>
  In step 6, the data from the first five steps 
  are used in LISA to estimate the probability of slope movement for each analysis 
  polygon. <a href="#table5">Table 5</a> shows probabilities for an <em>FOS</em> 
  less than 1 (P [<em>FOS</em>&le;1]) for undisturbed slopes. For all slope gradients 
  combined, the probability for slope failure is 1 percent, and for the steeper 
  slopes the probability is 10 percent. <a href="#table6">Table 6</a> shows probabilities of failure 
  for disturbed slopes. The values change greatly because of the loss of root 
  strength. All slopes combined are predicted to have a 10 percent probability 
  of failure and the steep slopes (&gt;35&deg;) had probabilities of failure ranging 
  from 45 to 73 percent. At this point in the analysis, the probabilities are 
  meaningless because we have no frame of reference. For example, do we know whether 
  10 percent probability is high or low? Undoubtedly, 73 percent is a high probability, 
  but what about 45 percent? The next step is to compare the LISA results with 
  previous slope movement activity in the study area.</p>
  <p>
  Most Forest Service specialists complete a time-series 
  aerial photographic analysis in step 7. If stereo-pair aerial photographs for 
  several years are available, this task becomes a simple exercise in comparing 
  previous slope movement with the slope instability predicted by LISA. If aerial 
  photographs are not available or if the photographic record is sporadic, this 
  step is difficult and, in most cases, requires additional field work (colloquially 
  referred to as ground-truthing). Fortunately, the aerial photographic record 
  of Forest Service lands in the Western United States is comprehensive from the 
  1940s to the present.</p>
  <p>
  Aerial photographs from the 1940s to the present 
  were available for the wildfire study. Thirty-eight debris flow movements, occurring 
  between 1949 and 1992, were identified and compared to information obtained 
  in the field reconnaissance and LISA results. When the comparison of observed 
  slope movements to predicted slope movements is completed, the LISA probabilities 
  become meaningful. In the wildfire study, the 25 percent probability value was 
  identified as a threshold for a medium hazard rating; similarly a 50 percent 
  probability was the high hazard rating threshold.</p>
  <p>
  To estimate the risk in a study area, the specialist 
  needs to identify consequences, such as loss of roads, bridges, wildlife habitats, 
  viewsheds, and water quality. The consequences can be estimated by an economic 
  cost analysis for tangible items, such as roads and bridges. For other resources, 
  such as habitats and viewsheds, this is not easily done. In the wildfire study 
  a comprehensive risk analysis is not complete, but consequences were identified 
  and discussed. Risk analysis work for this study will be completed in the near 
  future.</font></p>

  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></font></h4>

  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  Forest Service specialists have been using the DLISA and LISA models for nearly 
  a decade in evaluating hill-slope instability probabilities for study areas 
  mapped at a 1:24,000 scale. Using historical records and aerial photographs 
  from past years, the slope stability specialist can build a landslide database 
  for predicting future mass movements on hill slopes. Data from this landslide 
  database, in conjunction with data collected during field reconnaissance, are 
  used in DLISA to develop frequency distributions for the infinite slope equation 
  variables in LISA. Although these models will not predict a specific location 
  for a landslide initiation site, they can be applied in hazard/risk assessments. 
  These hazard/risk assessments can then be available for other resource professionals 
  and managers.<br>
