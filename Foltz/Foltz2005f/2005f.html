The US Forest Service has identified unmanaged all terrain vehicle (ATV) use as a threat to
forested lands and grasslands. Some undesirable impacts include severely eroded soils, user-created
unplanned roads, disrupted wetland ecosystems, as well as general habitat destruction
and degraded water quality throughout forested lands. More insight on how ATV use affects
trails is needed in order to make management decisions concerning ATV use on National Forest
lands. Factors which may determine impacts of ATVs include site characteristics, such as soil
moisture, soil types, existing terrain, and storm events, and ATV attributes such as vehicle type,
tire tread, amount of trail use, and rider attitude.
<br><br>
A study (in progress) is being conducted by the Rocky Mountain Research Station and the San
Dimas Technology Development Center to evaluate ATV impacts. Test loops were established
in six locations in the United States and included existing trails and new trails (with no former
ATV traffic). Test loops have varying terrain and soil characteristics and will each be driven with
a single vehicle and tire type to isolate factor effects. Trail sections will be evaluated with soil
and vegetation indices before and after the riding. Riders will make a fixed number of passes
over the test loops. Trails will be classified into one of three disturbances classes of Low,
Medium, and High, based on loss of litter/vegetation, and depth of wheel ruts. Following trail
condition assessment, rainfall simulations will be conducted to measure erosion prediction
parameters on each of the three disturbance classes.
<br><br>
Information acquired from this study will be used to develop an ATV impact assessment tool to
assist in the managing of ATV use. In addition, analysis of runoff and sediment production will
enable the calculation of erosion parameters for the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP)
model. This process-based model will allow users to make erosion estimates of ATV sites
beyond those included in this study.
