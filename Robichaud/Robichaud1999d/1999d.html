   <h3><a name="abstract">ABSTRACT</a></h3>

<p>Recent fires have renewed interest in fire's effect on
different components of the ecosystems, particularly erosion and
soil productivity. Our objectives were to </p>

<ol>
    <li>determine hillslope erosion rates after a high severity
        wildfire in an unmanaged forest stand; </li>
    <li>determine fire's short-term effects on nutrient loss. </li>
</ol>

<p>The study site was within an unmanaged forest area in the
Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, Eastern Oregon. The fire
consumed all downed woody debris larger than 75 mm diameter and
all standing trees were killed. In addition the entire forest
floor (duff) was consumed, leaving mineral soil exposed to
raindrop impact and overland flow. </p>

<p>Onsite erosion measurements were conducted for four years
after the wildfire. Silt fences were used to collect eroded
sediment on three slope classes (20, 30, and 60&nbsp;percent),
replicated twice, all within a high severity burn area. Mean
first year erosion rates were
   1.9&nbsp;Mg&nbsp;ha<sup>-1</sup>, decreasing to
   0.1&nbsp;Mg&nbsp;ha<sup>-1</sup> the second year, then to
   0.03&nbsp;Mg&nbsp;ha<sup>-1</sup> the third.
No erosion occurred the fourth year.
In year one, the 60&nbsp;percent slope
sites produced twice as much sediment as did the 20&nbsp;percent
slope sites. Soil nutrient losses followed the same pattern as
the sediment losses. High severity wildfires can produce
accelerated erosion and nutrient loss for the first year before
establishment of natural regeneration. </p>

<h3><a name="introduction">INTRODUCTION</a></h3>

<p>Fire is a natural and important part of the disturbance regime
for forested terrestrial and aquatic systems especially in the
western USA (Agee, 1993). However, much uncertainty exists in
determining the quantitative assessment of fire effects. Fire and
erosion are both natural processes that have been impacted by
forest management activities such as fire suppression, logging,
and road building during the last century. Management activities
contribute to increased sediment supplies to streams and rivers.
Additional sediment places streams and rivers at a higher risk
for degradation. Sediment adversely affects spawning and rearing
sites for anadromous and resident fish species, mobilizes
in-stream sediment, and destroys aquatic habitat. </p>

<p>Surface erosion is the movement of individual soil particles
by a force, either by uniform removal of material from the soil
surface (sheet erosion) or by concentrated removal of material in
the downslope direction (rill erosion) (Foster, 1982). Inherent
erosion hazards are defined as the site properties that influence
erosion. They include the ease with which the individual soil
particles are detached (soil erodibility), slope gradient and
length. Forces required to initiate and sustain the movement of
soil particles can be from many sources, such as raindrop impact
(Farmer and Van Haveren, 1971), overland flow (Meeuwig, 1971),
gravity, wind, and animal activity. Protection is provided by all
material on or above the soil surface, such as vegetation,
surface litter, duff, and rocks that reduce the impact of the
applied forces (Megahan, 1986; McNabb and Swanson, 1990). </p>

<p>Wildfires, which burn both small and large land areas, are
often associated with lightning strikes from thunderstorms during
the dry seasons and human-caused ignition (Agee, 1990). Fire
severity is a qualitative term used to measure the effect of fire
on ecosystem components (Walstad et al., 1990) and is often used
to describe fire effects on soil (Simard, 1991). Ryan and Noste
(1983) used ground char (burnt organic matter) classes to
quantify fire severity. High severity burn areas experience
higher rates of soil loss from erosion (McNabb and Swanson,
1990), increased peak flows of runoff, greater duff reduction,
loss in soil nutrients (Harvey at al., 1989), and soil heating
(Hungerford et al., 1991). </p>

<p>Potts et al. (1985) indicated that wildfires increased water
yield and sedimentation. Post-burn sediment increases were severe
only on sites with both steep slopes and large fires. They found
maximum annual sediment production of 4.3&nbsp;Mg&nbsp;ha<sup>-1</sup>,
an increase of 284&nbsp;percent over natural yields. These
estimates were based on large-scale regional estimates on
metamorphic parent material. Noble and Lundeen (1971) reported an
average annual sediment production rate of 5.7&nbsp;Mg&nbsp;ha<sup>-1</sup>
from a 365&nbsp;ha burn on steep river breaklands in the South
Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho. This was approximately seven
times greater than sediment yields from similar, unburned lands
in the vicinity. Radek (1996) observed erosion of 0.11 to
3.57&nbsp;Mg&nbsp;ha<sup>-1</sup> from several large wildfires,
that covered areas ranging from 200 to 1770&nbsp;ha in the
northern Cascades mountains. Three years after this fire, large
erosional events occurred from spring rainstorms, not from
snowmelt. Most of the sediment produced did not leave the burned
area. Sartz (1953) reported an average soil loss of 37&nbsp;mm
(&gt;300&nbsp;Mg&nbsp;ha<sup>-1</sup>) after a wildfire on a
north-facing slope in the Oregon Cascades. Sheet erosion and
raindrop splash accounted for the measured soil loss. Annual
precipitation was 107&nbsp;cm, with a maximum intensity of
90&nbsp;mm hr<sup>-1</sup>. Vegetation covered the site within
one year after the burn. </p>

<p>Objectives of this study were to determine hillslope erosion
rates after a high severity wildfire, and short-term effects on
nutrient loss and vegetation regrowth. </p>

<h3><a name="methods">METHODS</a></h3>

<h3><a name="sitedescription">Site Description</a></h3>

<p><a name="sitedescription">The study site (Twin Lakes) is
located in the Imnaha river basin, Wallowa-Whitman National
Forest in Eastern Oregon (lat. 45<sup>o</sup>&nbsp;7' long. 117<sup>o</sup>&nbsp;5')
and was unaffected by land management activities. This watershed
has a population of chinook salmon. A high priority for land
managers is protecting the aquatic ecosystem. High streamflows
occur within the drainage during snowmelt periods (May, June and
July) and during severe summer thunderstorms. </a></p>

<p><a name="sitedescription">The study site is generally
underlain by the Clover Creek Greenstone formation which is
composed of metamorphosed lavas and pyroclastic rocks capped by
glacial till. Slopes vary from 10 to 80&nbsp;percent. Elevation
ranges from 1400 to 2015&nbsp;m. Surface soils are predominately
derived from residual bedrock and glacial till. North aspects
with less than 60&nbsp;percent slopes have soils overlain with
ash from Mt. Mazama (B.P. 6700&nbsp;yrs) with a thickness greater
than 0.4&nbsp;m and less than 5&nbsp;percent rock fragment
content. Steeper slopes are overlain with less ash and contain
greater rock fragment contents. Southern aspects have an ash
thickness of 0.2&nbsp;m to 0.3&nbsp;m on slopes less than
60&nbsp;percent. Steeper slopes have less than 0.2&nbsp;m of ash
and 35&nbsp;percent or greater rock fragment. </a></p>

<p><a name="sitedescription"></a>North aspects overstory species are
grand fir (<i>Abies grandis</i>), Engelmann spruce (<i>Picea
engelmannii</i>), and Douglas fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>).
South aspects were characterized by ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus
ponderosa</i>) and Douglas fir.</p>

<p><a name="sitedescription"></a>
Lightning ignited a fast moving
wildfire on August 29, 1994 which burned 9000&nbsp;ha in
5&nbsp;days. The fire consumed all fuels larger than 75 mm
diameter and killed all standing trees. The entire forest floor
(duff) was consumed leaving the soil covered with ash.</p>

<h3><a name="siltfence">Silt Fence Measurements</a></h3>

<p>Six sites were selected for silt fence installation, two on
each of three slope classes of 20, 30 and 60&nbsp;percent. All
sites were within high severity burn areas as defined by Ryan and
Noste (1983). Criteria for site selection were size and
uniformity of slope and sediment contributing areas. Study site
characteristics are described in

<a href="#table1"
 onMouseOver="window.status='Table 1: Site characteristics for the Twin Lakes study area.'; return true"
 onMouseOut="window.status=''; return true">Table 1</A>.
</p>

<p>Silt fences were installed on the contour with a longitudinal
downslope bow so sediment could not travel around the outer fence
edges. Average silt fence length was 9&nbsp;m. Silt fences were
installed by initially digging a narrow, slightly curved ditch
25&nbsp;cm deep in the soil. The bottom of the silt fence was
folded into the bottom of the ditch and covered with soil and
compacted to stabilize the silt fence bottom. Stakes (5&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>
by 1.2&nbsp;m) were inserted in sewn casings in the silt fence
(2.5&nbsp;m apart) and driven into the ground. Additional stakes
were installed every 0.6&nbsp;m to prevent any fabric stressing.
The silt fence was tied to the stakes. The uphill side of the
silt fence (about 0.5&nbsp;m width) serves as the sediment
deposition area which was smoothed and compacted. </p>

<p>Measurement of the deposited sediment was determined manually
from the uphill side of each silt fence. Sediment was scraped
from the compacted ground surface and weighed onsite with a
portable scale. Subsamples (200&nbsp;gm) were taken for moisture
determination, nutrient analysis and particle size determination.
Sediment was collected bi-annually and combined for annual
totals. </p>

<p>Soil nutrients were determined on the fine fraction soil
(&lt;&nbsp;2&nbsp;mm) following air drying. Soil Potassium (K)
was extracted with a solution of 0.75<i>N</i>&nbsp;NaOAc and
analyzed by atomic absorption (Helmke and Sparks, 1996). Nitrate
(NO<sub>3</sub>) and available ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub>) was
extracted with a solution of 2<i>N</i> KCl and analyzed by
colorimetry (Mulvaney, 1996). Vegetation coverage was estimated
ocularly in 19 m<sup>2</sup> areas at each site during the first
and second growing seasons. </p>

<h3><a name="results"></a>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</h3>

<h4><a name="sedimentcollection"></a>Sediment collection</h4>

<p>Mean annual erosion rates were highest the first year with
  2.5&nbsp;Mg&nbsp;ha<sup>-1</sup> sediment collected from the 60&nbsp;percent slopes,
  2.2&nbsp;Mg&nbsp;ha<sup>-1</sup> sediment collected from the 30&nbsp;percent slope, and
  1.1&nbsp;Mg&nbsp;ha<sup>-1</sup>
sediment collected from the 20&nbsp;percent slope 
(<a href="#fig1"
  onMouseOver="window.status='Figure 1: Mean erosion rates and precipitation during the four years after the wildfire'; return true"
  onMouseOut="window.status=''; return true">Figure&nbsp;1</a>).

Year one values were significantly higher (<font size="3" face="Symbol">a</font><i>=0.05</i>) than the subsequent years'
erosion rates. Erosion rates dropped seven fold on the
60&nbsp;percent slopes, and dropped two orders of magnitude on
the 30&nbsp;percent slopes and 20&nbsp;percent slopes during the
second year. By the fourth year no erosion occurred from any of
the plots. One of the 30&nbsp;percent slope sites had the highest
erosion rate measured during the first year (4.4&nbsp;Mg&nbsp;ha<sup>-1</sup>).
Whereas, the other 30&nbsp;percent slope site did not produce any
erosion; this was due to soil coverage by moss and lichens
shortly after the fire. This site was adjacent to a natural
spring which may have caused higher soil moisture contents during
the fire; thus it did not burn as severely and the moss and
lichens were easily reestablished. </p>

 <p>
 Erosion rate reduction was due to recovery of natural vegetation.
 First year growing season shrubs (3&nbsp;percent), forbs (7&nbsp;percent) and grasses (18&nbsp;percent) accounted
 for 28&nbsp;percent of the total ground cover.
 After the second growing season, shrubs (36&nbsp;percent), forbs (22&nbsp;percent)
 and grasses (24&nbsp;percent) accounted for 82&nbsp;percent of the total ground cover.
 Previous work by Robichaud (1996) indicate an erosion reduction by increasing ground cover after prescribed fire.
 </p>

<p>Particle size distribution analysis showed eroded sediment was
more fine than the in situ soil, especially from the steepest slope sites 
(<a href="#table1"
 onMouseOver="window.status='Site characteristics for the Twin Lakes study area.'; return true"
 onMouseOut="window.status=''; return true">Table 1</A>).
 This was probably due to loss of organic matter that binds particles during the fire. Also, the
 breakdown of aggregates during the fire and during sediment transport resulted in finer soil particles.
 </p>

<h4><a name="nutrientlosses"></a>Nutrient Losses</h4>

<p>Eroded sediment nutrient analysis indicate the largest flush of K, NO<sub>3</sub> and NH<sub>4</sub> loss correlated well
(correlation coefficient = 0.61 for K, 0.73 for NO<sub>3</sub>, and 0.47 for NH<sub>4</sub>; <i>n=36</i>) with the sediment
losses. Mean nutrient losses were the highest in year one 
 (1&nbsp;kg&nbsp;ha<sup>-1</sup> K, 
  0.4&nbsp;kg&nbsp;ha<sup>-1</sup> NO<sub>3</sub> and
  0.05&nbsp;kg&nbsp;ha<sup>-1</sup> NH<sub>4</sub>)
and negligible by year three

(<a href="#fig2"
 onMouseOver="window.status='Figure 2: Mean nutrient losses in the sediment for all sites combined'; return true"
 onMouseOut="window.status=''; return true">Figure&nbsp;2</a>).

Soil <i>K</i> concentrations in the sediment decreased from
 455 to 61&nbsp;g&nbsp;Mg<sup>-1</sup> from the first to the third year and NO<sub>3</sub> concentration decreased from
 129 to 2&nbsp;g&nbsp;Mg<sup>-1</sup> 

(<a href="#fig3"
 onMouseOver="window.status='Figure 3: Nutrient concentration in the eroded sediment'; return true"
 onMouseOut="window.status=''; return true">Figure&nbsp;3</a>).

This decrease was due to the ease in which they were leached from the soil and or lost by percolation since they are negatively charged.
Ammonium concentrations increased from
 22 to 48&nbsp;g&nbsp;Mg<sup>-1</sup>, probably due to decomposition of the new vegetation or condensation within the soil profile.

<p>
Some deep rills were observed in and near the study site indicating that the eroded sediment was not only from sheet
erosion but also included concentrated flow (rill) erosion. If the soil loss was hypothetically spread over the site with no
rill erosion, the depth of topsoil loss would be 6&nbsp;mm on the steep slopes and 1.5 to 2&nbsp;mm on the low slopes. Thus depth
of soil loss from erosion after the fire is unlikely to be detrimental to the long-term soil productivity. But, since there
was not uniform sheet erosion over the entire area, site/soil productivity probably may have been impacted in isolated
concentrated flow paths only. Site/soil productivity may have been reduced during the fire (Harvey et al., 1989) but not due to
erosion.

<h3><a name="conclusion">CONCLUSION</a></h3>

<p>Erosion rates were highest first year post-fire. Most erosion
occurred during spring runoff. By the second year, erosion rates
were one to two orders of magnitude less due to vegetative
regrowth. Nutrient losses followed the same pattern as the
sediment losses with most losses occurring in year one. Volatile
nutrient loss due to the fire are more likely to reduce the
productivity (Harvey et al., 1989) than losses due to erosion
(DeBano et al., 1998).

<p>These erosion rates and nutrient loss estimates indicate
unmanaged forest fire effects occur primarily the first year.
Periodic wildfires and accelerated erosional and hydrological
responses are part of natural ecosystem processes.
