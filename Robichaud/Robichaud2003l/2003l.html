<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Prescribed fires increasingly are 
  being used to reduce hazardous fuels, a major objective of the National Fire 
  Plan. However, despite advancing technology and ever-improving models, determining 
  the best time for a prescribed burn is still a challenge.<BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After gathering data and applying models, the 
  fire manager may pick up a bit of duff, or organic material, squeeze it firmly 
  and check the moisture before giving approval to begin the burn. The fire manager 
  uses past experience, weather information and a &quot;feel&quot; for the current 
  conditions as a final check.<BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of fire on the forest floor can vary 
  from merely removing the litter to totally consuming the duff, which exposes 
  the mineral soil and alters the surface soil structure. Fire managers often 
  design prescribed fires to leave a portion of residual duff material to protect 
  the mineral soil. Duff thickness and moisture content are the most important 
  factors in determining duff consumption during fires. Using a measured duff 
  moisture content in models like the
  <a href="https://fire.org/nav.mas?pages=fofem&mode=1" target="fofem">First Order Fire Effects Model</a>
  from the USDA Forest Service, fire managers can improve the estimate of duff remaining 
  after a burn.<bR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there is an additional tool available. The 
  DMM600 duff moisture meter provides reliable, real-time measurements of duff 
  moisture content.</font>

      IT WORKS</font></strong><br>
      In comparison to other woody fuels, duff moisture content has greater spatial 
      and temporal variation. Small precipitation events and heavy dew accumulations 
      that have negligible effect on the moisture content of large fuel can significantly 
      increase the moisture content of fine fuels and litter. Subsurface duff 
      can lose moisture through evaporation much more quickly than the large woody 
      fuels. Due to subtle differences in canopy closure, slope, aspect and micro-topography, 
      duff moisture levels can vary significantly across the landscape, even at 
      the hill slope scale. These variations make it important to use real-time 
      duff moisture measurements to estimate duff consumption and, more importantly, 
      desired post-fire duff depths.</font></td>

  <font size="2"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic field use.</strong></font> 
  The sample is collected from the portion of the duff layer just above the soil 
  mineral horizon and is pushed through a No. 4</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">mesh 
  sieve that fits in the opening of the sample chamber. Passing the duff through 
  the sieve breaks up large organic fragments and removes sticks and rocks to 
  allow for more uniform packing. Once the sieved material fills the chamber, 
  the cap is put on and the compression knob turned until an audible indicator 
  signals the sample is properly compressed. Upon proper compression, the instrument 
  automatically takes the measurement, which is immediately visible in the display 
  at the base of the instrument. Readings are displayed in real-time only; measurements 
  are not stored. Total time needed to sieve and measure each sample is about 
  30 seconds.<br>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></font></font><font size="2"><strong>Operation 
  principles</strong></font>. The tough, lightweight DMM600 is a portable, battery-powered 
  sensor that was developed from frequency domain reflectometry technology, commonly 
  known as FDR. When proper pressure triggers a measurement, a high-frequency 
  signal of 42MHZ is applied to the wave guide at the base of the sample chamber, 
  and the sensor electronics detect the change in frequency of the reflected signal. 
  The frequency change depends on the dielectric constant of the medium adjacent 
  to the wave guide. Since the dielectric constant of the medium varies with moisture 
  content, the frequency change can be easily related, through a simple calibration 
  function, to provide a moisture content measurement. The unit's microprocessor 
  uses a factory-supplied calibration to convert the frequency to a volumetric 
  moisture content and displays the value in the LCD readout.<br>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></font></font>Air 
  voids in the organic material may reduce the apparent dielectric constant and/or 
  create a poor contact between the duff and the waveguide located at the base 
  of the sample chamber. Using the meter's compression feature on sieved duff 
  ensures each sample is pressed evenly against the wave guide, which reduces 
  measurement variability. An audible signal tells the user when correct compression, 
  15 pounds, is applied and the measurement is complete.</font>

   <strong><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calibration.</font></strong> 
  The factory-supplied calibration for the DMM600 is derived from laboratory measurements 
  of the volumetric moisture content of duff from eight different forested sites. 
  Given the elevation differences of these sites, the cover species varied to 
  include
     spruce (<i>Picea engelmannii</i>),
     alpine fir (<i>Abies lasiocarpa</i>), 
     lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i>),
     larch (<i>Larix occidentalis</i>),
     ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>) and
     Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>).
  <br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Because the individual calibration curves were similar, the data were combined to develop 
  a single, standard calibration curve (see below.) The error bars indicate that 
  the measurement accuracy decreases as moisture content increases. The accuracy 
  is approximately &plusmn; 4% at 60% volumetric moisture content and approximately 
  &plusmn;1.5% at 30% volumetric moisture content. It's recommended that the average 
  of samples from several nearby locations be used to reduce the effects of natural 
  variability.</font>

      can be determined using the laboratory procedures described in the DMM600 
      instruction manual and the DMM600 calibration Excel spreadsheet provided 
      in the PCDMM software package. User-defined calibrations are entered into 
      the PCDMM interface and loaded to the DMM600 through a serial port connection. 
      Studies done on eastern hardwood duff from Massachusetts show little deviation 
      from the standard calibration curve. It is likely that the standard calibration 
      curve will meet the needs of most fire managers across a range of vegetation 
      types.</font> </td>

   <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volumetric versus gravimetric.</strong></font>
   The basic operation of the DMM600 gives the volumetric moisture content of the sampled 
  duff. Using a simple calibration process, the gravimetric, dry weight-based 
  moisture content &#8212; the measurement most commonly used by fire managers 
  &#8212; can be added to the instrument readout.<br>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></font></font><strong><font size="2"></font></strong>A 
  value for duff bulk density is needed for this calibration process. Fire managers 
  may choose to use a known bulk density value or determine one from local conditions, 
  using the equation <font size="2"><strong>bulk density = dry weight/volume</strong></font>. 
  Each coefficient in the standard calibration equation is divided by the bulk 
  density.<br>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></font></font>The 
  three gravimetric coefficients are entered into the PCDMM software and uploaded 
  to the DMM600 via a serial port connection on the base. Because duff bulk density 
  is relatively constant, this calibration process can be completed prior to going 
  to the field to make duff moisture measurements. When each field measurement 
  is made, the standard volumetric moisture content and the user-defined gravimetric 
  moisture content are alternately displayed in the readout.</font>
<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duff moisture content is critical 
  information for fire managers making operational and planning decisions for 
  prescribed burns. The DMM600 duff moisture meter provides dependable duff moisture 
  content data in the field and for input in predictive modeling programs.</font>
