  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent fires have renewed interest in fire's 
  effect on different components of the ecosystem, in particular fire's effects 
  on infiltration and runoff. Forests subjected to high severity burns often develop 
  water repellent soil conditions. Under this condition, the infiltration of water 
  into the soil is lowered and consequently additional runoff occurs. Increased 
  runoff can contribute to surface erosion and lead to sediment deposition in 
  downstream areas. <br>
  In this study, a rainfall simulator was used to compare infiltration rates from 
  plots located in high severity burned areas to plots in undisturbed areas on 
  the Sula Ranger District, Bitterroot National Forest in western Montana after 
  the 2000 fire season. Simulated rainfall was applied to 102 0.5 m<sup>2</sup> plots for 
  60 min at 100 mm hr<sup>-1</sup>. Bottles collected runoff at 1 and 2-min intervals. 
  There were 15 plots for each of the four burned sites, and 14 plots for the 
  three unburned sites, half of which had their rootmat removed. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Results indicate naturally occurring water 
  repellent soil conditions of the surface on the unburned, rootmat-removed treatment, 
  which had the lowest infiltration rates. The burned plots on the other hand 
  had a water repellent layer centimeters beneath the soil surface. This allowed 
  for some water storage in the surface layer while also maintaining low infiltration 
  rates even below what was expected, especially towards the end of the simulation 
  runs. These results are most likely due to the extremely dry state of the soil 
  and the natural water repellent condition that is common in volcanic ash-cap 
  soils. </font>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wildfires are naturally occurring events 
  that act as important disturbance mechanisms for ecosystems. Over the last century, 
  land management agencies have intentionally suppressed wildfires under the conjecture 
  that fires are destructive. Fire suppression allows forests to build up biomass, 
  which contributes to the development of high severity fires, particularly across 
  the western United States. When ignited, these large fuel loads may burn at 
  higher intensities and longer durations than under most periodic fire cycles 
  resulting in high severity fires. These fire behavior conditions transfer enormous 
  amounts of heat to the mineral soil (Robichaud at al., 2000). The intense heat 
  can alter the mineral soil structure by closing soil pores (Wells et al., 1979) 
  and destroying fine roots, fire can also reduce soil productivity and increase 
  runoff, thereby causing increased watershed response and downstream sedimentation 
  (Robichaud et al., 2000).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measurement of fire severity is qualitative 
  and based on the effects the fire has on site resources (Hartford and Frandsen, 
  1992; Ryan and Noste, 1983). As more forest floor is consumed, more heat is 
  generated, and the degree of burn severity increases. Increased severity gives 
  rise to the potential development of water repellent soil conditions. Water 
  repellency develops when hydrophobic organic matter is vaporized under intense 
  heat from a severe burn and then condenses onto cooler underlying soil layers 
  creating a layer impermeable to water (DeBano, 1966 and 1981; DeBano et al., 
  1998). The water repellency of soils decreases infiltration rates (Robichaud, 
  2000) thus leading to an increase in water runoff and downstream sediment yields 
  (Wells et al., 1979). In addition to the water repellency developed in a severe 
  burn, the infiltration rates after wildfires decrease by the sealing of soil 
  pores (Wells et al., 1979), and the exposed soil can be transported easily as 
  sediment (White and Wells, 1982; Giovannini and Lucchesi, 1983; Scott et al.,1998). 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Variable degrees of water repellency develop 
  in soils after wildfires. Parameters governing this development are soil texture, 
  antecedent moisture content, fire intensity, and the amount of time following 
  the fire. DeBano (1981) and Robichaud (2000) suggest that infiltration may decrease 
  due to the fire, but will increase with time because the hydrophobic substances 
  responsible for water repellency are slightly water-soluble and slowly dissolve, 
  thereby increasing wettability (Robichaud, 2000). In general, water repellent 
  soil conditions are broken up or washed away within one to two years after the 
  fire (Robichaud, 2000). Studies have also shown that Northern Rocky Mountain 
  forest soils often consist of volcanic ash-cap soils which, when dry and unheated, 
  promote naturally occurring water repellent conditions (Robichaud and Hungerford, 
  2000). <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of this study was to evaluate 
  the effect of high severity fire on infiltration rates into a naturally water 
  repellent ash-cap soil. Our hypothesis was that the severely burned area would 
  have less infiltration due to the water repellent soil condition caused by the 
  fire, but unburned areas would also show traces of pre-existing water repellency.

<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Methods and Site Description 
  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study was conducted on the Sula Ranger 
  District of the Bitterroot National Forest in Western Montana during the fall 
  of 2000. Slopes of the plots within the studied areas ranged from 25 to 55 percent 
  with dominantly west-southwestern aspects. The predominant soil is derived from 
  volcanic ash over highly weathered granite and is classified as a sandy skeletal 
  Andic-Dystrocryept. Elevation of the area was approximately 1,950 meters. Vegetation 
  of the area consisted of sub-alpine fir and Menziesia.<Br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burned study area is located on White 
  Stallion Mountain in the Upper North Fork Rye Creek area. A lightning strike 
  ignited this area and 40 % of the total burned area of 101,000 ha suffered a 
  high severity burn condition as defined by Ryan and Noste (1983). The fire killed 
  all standing trees and consumed all vegetative fuels, leaving the mineral soil 
  covered with ash. Four sites were selected within the study area based on their 
  slope, aspect, proximity to the road, and similar soil and vegetative characteristics. 
  On each of the four sites, 15 0.5 m<sup>2</sup> plots were randomly located. 
  The plots were bordered by 15 cm wide sheet metal inserted vertically 5 cm into 
  the mineral soil. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three sites were selected in an unburned 
  area located approximately 3 km north of the burned area. These selected sites 
  had slope, aspect, soil type and vegetative characteristics similar to the burned 
  area. On each of the three sites, 14 0.5 m<sup>2</sup> plots were selected. 
  For each site, seven plots had the rootmat removed, leaving the mineral soil 
  exposed, and the other seven plots were not disturbed. The seven undisturbed 
  plots were intended to show the effects organic vegetative matter has on infiltration. 
  <br>
  A simulated rainfall event was applied to each of the 102 plots for 60 minutes 
  using the USDA-Forest Service and the USDA-Agricultural Research Service oscillating 
  nozzle rainfall simulators. The mean rainfall intensity was 100 mm hr<sup>-1</sup>. 
  The rainfall events were conducted on the plots with the existing soil moisture 
  condition. Two soil moisture probes were inserted at 5 and 10 cm below the surface 
  of the plot to monitor changing moisture conditions during the rainfall event. 
  A covered trough at the low end of each plot funneled runoff water and sediment 
  through a valved pipe for timed volume samples. The samples were manually collected 
  in 1000 ml bottles at 1-minute intervals for the first 14 minutes, then at 2-minute 
  intervals for the remainder of the 60-minute run. At the end of each run, any 
  sediment in the trough was washed into a sample bottle. All runoff samples were 
  weighed and oven-dried to determine total runoff volumes and sediment concentrations 
  in order to develop hydrographs and sedigraphs (Robichaud et al., 1994). <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-burn sampling included the degree of 
  water repellency, depth of water penetration into the soil profile, ash depth, 
  and bulk density. At each plot before simulation began, water repellency was 
  measured using the water drop penetration time (WDPT) method (DeBano, 1981). 
  Eight drops of water were placed in a row on the mineral surface layer next 
  to each plot using an eyedropper. The time the drop remained on the surface 
  in a spherical state was recorded as the penetration time. The maximum time 
  was limited to 5 minutes. If the drop penetrated before 5 minutes then consecutive 
  drops were placed at 1 cm depth increments to a maximum depth of 6 cm. At each 
  increment they were timed for penetration.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Results and Discussion</strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average hydrographs for the burned and 
  rootmat-removed treatments showed results that were counter to what was anticipated 
  (<a href="#Fig1">Fig.1</a>). The burned plots were expected to produce the highest 
  amount of runoff, but the results showed the unburned plots, with the rootmat-removed, 
  produced the highest amount of runoff.</font></p>

  1.</strong> Average hydrographs from each of the three treatments</em></font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
  burned plots averaged approximately 75 mm hr<sup>-1</sup> while the rootmat-removed 
  averaged approximately 90 mm hr<sup>-1</sup>. The three plot treatments all 
  produced hydrographs that increased quickly within the first seven minutes, 
  then leveled off and maintained fairly constant runoff rates until the simulated 
  rain event ended at 60 minutes. Robichaud (2000), suggested that under fire-induced 
  water repellent conditions, runoff rates should quickly peak and then begin 
  declining as the hydrophobic substances of the soil are broken down, thus increasing 
  infiltration over time (Fig 2b). He also showed that before a severe burn occurs, 
  little water repellency should exist within the soil (Fig. 2a). The undisturbed 
  hydrograph shows runoff occurring at approximately 13 mm hr<sup>-1</sup> and 
  no significant detection of a water repellent condition. This is the outcome 
  expected from initially non-water repellent soils in which the organic surface 
  layer absorbs much of the water and slowly allows it to percolate through the 
  soil profile. The hydrograph in figure 2b represents his study for a similar 
  area after a severe burn. Severe water repellent conditions exist, but they 
  decrease as the water soluble hydrophobic substances are broken down and thus 
  the infiltration increases. <br>

  </font></p>
<p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because 
  the unburned rootmat-removed plots in this study produced more runoff than did 
  the burned plots, the soil must have been naturally water repellent prior to 
  the experiment. To further validate this hypothesis, compare the runoff rates 
  for the undisturbed plots from the two soil types, Figs. 1 and 2a. The naturally 
  repellent soil averages a runoff rate around 65 mm hr<sup>-1</sup> while the 
  non repellent soil averages around 15 mm hr<sup>-1</sup>. The studies conducted 
  in this paper and in Robichaud (2000) were within close proximity to one another 
  and used similar procedures. The results suggest that the different soils played 
  a part in infiltration rates. The previous study area involved soil types of 
  Typic Cryoboralf and Dystic Cryochrept, which are both formed from weathered 
  rhyolite. These soils do not exhibit naturally water repellent conditions. Ash-cap 
  soils are especially water repellent when low in moisture and unburned as shown 
  by lab studies conducted by Robichaud et al. (2000) where they simulated burn 
  treatments on different soil types. Additionally, Walsh et al. (1994) and Doerr 
  and Thomas (2000) concluded that soil water repellency is most severe in the 
  dry summer. When the experiments of this study were conducted during the fall 
  of 2000, the area had been suffering from a long drought period and low snowfall 
  from the previous winter. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total infiltration was calculated through 
  a mass balance equation of rain applied minus the runoff that was captured in 
  the manually gathered samples. Within each treatment, the plots showed no significant 
  difference. T-tests, however, did show significant differences (&alpha; =0.05) 
  of the total infiltration values for the three treatments (Fig. 3). The rootmat-removed 
  treatment had the lowest mean infiltration (24 mm) followed by the burned treatment 
  (33 mm) and then the undisturbed treatment (46 mm). These infiltration values 
  correspond to the hydrographs in <a href="#Fig1">figure 1</a>. </font></p>

  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another 
  factor affecting infiltration is the amount of surface storage that occurs in 
  different capacities for each of these treatments. It is also important to recognize 
  large variability that typically exists with these results due to the inherent 
  difference in site microtopography, fine root distribution, and root holes. 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The WDPT tests and soil moisture probes 
  further explain the results that indicate naturally occurring water repellent 
  soil conditions, which affect infiltration and storage. A total of 480 WDPT 
  tests were run on the burned sites and 336 on the unburned sites. Both the rootmat-removed 
  and undisturbed plots are accounted for because the WDPT test is conducted on 
  mineral soil. Therefore, the vegetative cover is removed on all unburned plots 
  for the WDPT tests. The results of the WDPT tests show that for both unburned 
  and burned sites a large percentage of the tests, 77 % and 60 % respectively, 
  detected severe water repellency (&gt;180 sec) within the soil profile (Table 
  1). Both treatments showed the same percentage of non-repellent soils at approximately 
  3 %. These percentages are further described in Table 2 in order to show where 
  the water repellency occurred within the soil profile. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
  three classes of water repellency: slight, moderate, and severe, had unique 
  distribution patterns for the two treatments: burned and unburned. When water 
  repellency was detected from the WDPT tests on the unburned plots it occurred 
  on the surface 76, 63, and 80 % of the time for the respective severities of 
  slight, moderate, and severe. It then proceeded to decrease as the depth reached 
  3 cm. There was no evidence of water repellent soil below a depth of 3 cm on 
  the unburned sites. The burned areas, on the other hand, resulted in few tests 
  (5 % that were severe) which exhibited water repellency on the surface. These 
  results support the fact that natural water repellency is typical of dry soils 
  (DeBano, 1973; Dekker and Ritsema, 1994). The water repellent layer on the burned 
  plots was distributed from just below the surface to 3 cm depth. This provided 
  a thick layer of water repellency within the soil profile. Several tests showed 
  water repellency continuing down to 5 cm on these plots. This indicates the 
  fire causes a redistribution of the hydrophobic substance throughout the soil 
  profile while in the unburned condition it occurs primarily at the surface. 
  As a result, more runoff occurred from the rootmat-removed plots as shown from 
  the hydrographs. Generally these water repellent layers are broken down within 
  10 to 15 minutes after rain begins (Robichaud, 2000). This did not occur on 
  these plots. The fact that water repellency becomes distributed within the soil 
  profile when a soil is burned explains the results from two soil moisture probes. 
  The probes were placed at approximately 5 and 10 cm depths to monitor the changing 
  moisture conditions of the <br>
  soil (<a href="#Fig4">Fig 4</a>). <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results from the soil probe data suggest 
  a combined effect of infiltration, runoff, and storage. Both soil probes detected 
  more moisture from the undisturbed and rootmat-removed plots than from the burned 
  plots. This is counter to what would be expected by the results of the runoff 
  hydrograph and cumulative infiltration box plots. A storage layer may account 
  for the difference. The distribution of the water repellent layer when the soil 
  is burned creates a surface that exhibits low water repellency and acts as a 
  small storage reservoir which allows water to accumulate in this layer. When 
  this layer becomes saturated the water continues to run off rather than infiltrate 
  because of the large water repellent region below the surface. This storage 
  capacity is by far smaller than the storage capacity of the organic surface 
  for the undisturbed plots. It is likely that the top organic layer holds a large 
  amount of water before it becomes saturated. At saturation the water hits the 
  water repellent surface of soil, which inhibits water infiltration. The soil 
  moisture probes in the rootmat-removed plots detected the high water content 
  because the top layer is water repellent and has almost no storage; thus a portion 
  of the water did infiltrate causing the higher moisture readings. The percentage 
  of water that infiltrates is higher than the others but low relative to the 
  amount of runoff. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="4">Conclusion</font></strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This study showed that soil type plays a 
  role in the infiltration and runoff characteristics. Volcanic ash-cap soil have 
  naturally occurring water repellent characteristics, which prior to the fire 
  are concentrated on the surface layer. This was shown by the highest runoff 
  rates from the rootmat-removed sites and the high rate of runoff resulting from 
  the undisturbed vegetated plots. This water repellency diminished quickly with 
  increasing depth. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a high severity burn, these ash-cap 
  soils no longer had a water repellent layer at the surface, but rather distributed 
  it into a layer between the surface and a 3 cm depth, sometimes extending to 
  5 cm depth. The top layer of the burned soil exhibited minimal water repellency 
  and thus acted as a small storage space for water while the thick layer of distributed 
  water repellent soil restricts water from infiltrating. The soil moisture detected 
  at depths within the soil profile suggested that the surface storage capacity 
  combined with the amount of runoff influenced infiltration. <br>
