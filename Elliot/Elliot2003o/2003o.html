<p><strong>Summary</strong><br>
  Many of the forests in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world are source areas 
  for water. The quantity and quality of this water are major public concerns. 
  In a forested watershed, any road segment, harvesting operation, or other management 
  activity can adversely impact forest streams. These disturbances are distributed 
  in both time and space. The disturbance in the first year may have minimal impact 
  on the hydrologic integrity of the watershed, but if the disturbance in the 
  following year is added to the first, and the disturbance in year 3 added to 
  those in years 1 and 2, the net effect may be detrimental to the beneficial 
  uses of the stream. A model to address this cumulative impact is sometimes referred 
  to as a cumulative effects model. This paper presents the application of the 
  GeoWEPP Geographic Information System (GIS) tool to evaluating cumulative effects 
  in forests due to fuel management activities. An example is given to demonstrate 
  the utility and limitations of the current tool.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
  Forests provide society with numerous resources including fiber, food, recreation, 
  and water. Activities associated with obtaining some of these resources may 
  adversely affect others. One conflict, in particular, is that any disturbance 
  associated with obtaining fiber or food, and many recreational activities, can 
  adversely impact forest water quality.<br><br>
  A single disturbance in a given year is seldom a problem. Forest watersheds 
  are able to recover within a few years from most single disturbance events, 
  including disturbances as extreme as wildfire. As more disturbances are added 
  during a year, and additional disturbances in the years that follow, the forest 
  is less likely to recover to an undisturbed condition. The cumulative effects 
  of numerous disturbances over a number of years must be considered to be able 
  to manage forests for multiple uses.<br><br>
  The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) (Flanagan and Livingston, 1995) 
  was developed by a number of United States Department of Agriculture research 
  and management agencies. Scientists at the Rocky Mountain Research Station and 
  elsewhere parameterised the model for forests (Elliot and Hall, 1997). The WEPP 
  model was released with both a &#8220;hillslope&#8221; and a &#8220;watershed&#8221; 
  version. Developing topographic input files for the watershed version was not 
  easily achieved until in 2001, when a Geographic Information System (GIS) tool 
  was developed to assist in spatial analysis and visualization of erosion distribution 
  (Renschler et al., 2002).
</p>
<p><strong>Application of GeoWEPP to Watershed Analysis</strong><br>
  To evaluate the suitability of the GeoWEPP tool, an example study was carried 
  out on a 1490 ha watershed about 25 km north of Moscow, Idaho (Figure 1). The 
  GeoWEPP tool divided the watershed into 33 hillslopes, and 13 channel segments. 
  The watershed is currently under consideration for significant fuel reduction 
  activities, including small diameter logging in year one, prescribed fire in 
  year 2, and recovery of hydrologic stability and vegetative cover during the 
  next five years. Table 1 shows the sequence of vegetation and soil properties 
  necessary to sequentially describe these disturbances and recovery years. </p>

<p>To demonstrate the application of GeoWEPP, each year a hillslope was selected, 
  starting with hillslopes at the bottom of the watershed, to initiate the fuel 
  reduction sequence. We assumed that all other hillslopes were covered in forest 
  at the start of the simulations. Figure 2 shows the sediment yields for the 
  first 12 years of analysis, for both the disturbed hillslopes and the road network. 
  Note that the first year assumed that all hillslopes were undisturbed, and the 
  majority of the soil erosion was from the road. During the years of this example, 
  the sediment yields varied between 40 and 90 tonnes, depending on the size and 
  location of the disturbed hillslopes.</p>

  To consider the sediment from roads, sediment delivery was modelled assuming 
  a road erosion rate of 1.33 t/km on roads with heavy traffic, and 0.67 t/km 
  for roads with light traffic. These values were estimated with the WEPP model 
  for multiple 60-m long road segments with gradients of 4 percent, distances 
  of 20 m between the road and the stream, and with buffers covered in forest. 
  The rill erodibility value was reduced from 0.0003 s/m for the road with traffic 
  to 0.000075 s/m for the road with low traffic, to reflect the observed surface 
  armouring on roads without traffic (Foltz, 1998). It is apparent from figure 
  2 that the sediment from the road accounts for about a fourth of the sediment 
  generated from human disturbances during active years, and 96 percent of the 
  sediment in the absence of disturbances. The road sediment delivery values are 
  approximate estimates in this study, as a detailed road map was not available. 
  The relative importance of roads in the analysis, however is unlikely to change 
  with greater detail.<br><br>
  These sediment yield rates need to be compared to the expected sediment yield 
  from natural disturbances. When the entire watershed was described as wildfire, 
  the predicted sediment yield was 4832 tonnes in the year of the fire. If the 
  frequency of fire in this area is assumed to be about 48 years, then the average 
  annual sediment generated in the year following the wildfire averages about 
  100 tonnes per year. If fuel management operations reduce the likelihood of 
  fire, or the severity of the fire, as has been observed in recent studies, then 
  the average annual sediment production due to the operations is less than the sediment 
  from wildfire. </p>
<p>
  To complete the analysis, some users may wish to add in sediment from landslides. 
  McClelland et al. (1997) found that typical sediment yields averaged over the 
  20 year return period associated with such events was around 10 t/ha. Operations 
  are unlikely to decrease this value, but a more dense road network could increase 
  it.<br><br>
  Currently, the WEPP model predicts only surface runoff. Observations in many 
  steep forest watersheds have shown that over 99 percent of all runoff is subsurface 
  flow. Work is ongoing to incorporate subsurface flow into the WEPP model (Wu 
  et al., 2000).</p>
<p><br>
  In summary, we have presented the application of the new GeoWEPP spatial analysis 
  tool to cumulative watershed effects analysis. At this time, the tool is run 
  for each year of disturbance. If desired, users can then add the sediment impact 
  due to roads, wildfire, or landslides.<br>
